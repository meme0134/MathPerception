"List of websites, ebooks, downloads, etc. for mobile users and people too lazy to read the sidebar.","All, I have fallen in love with the youtube channel ""Mrs Joann's School"" She does an amazing job in giving a very one on one, motherly, and fun feel to learning math. Going from Grade 1 all the way to GED level math ( and I hope early physics and pre calc soon...)  Seriously check her out, I love the method and how she gives everything in a very calm, manner that almost feels so relaxed, calming and she gives plenty of examples and goes at a slow pace. Obviously she builds off of prior lessons, but provides links to like every video remotely linked to the topic...
Please give her some views and try out her teaching style!

It's especially suited for practicing or refreshing the basics of algebra and calculus, but can also be used to learn the formalisms and rules from scratch.

If you tried it, I'd love to hear any feedback you have!"
[Megathread] Post your favorite (or your own) resources/channels/what have you.,"Starting with the obvious ones:

1. Khan Academy
2. Wolfram Alpha
3. 3Blue1Brown

The less obvious to the mainstream, but perhaps obvious to normal self learners:

1. [Brilliant.org](https://Brilliant.org)
2. Crash Course Algebra

The not very well known outside of certain circles ones:

1. FreeCodeCamp (If you look through they have a lot of math courses. Most are 12-14 long video's that deep dive one thing. 

My personal favorite learning flow:

1. Use Khan Academy as the main source of knowledge. This is the one you go from Algebra --> Calculus on and the one that you focus on complete mastery. 
2. Use [Brilliant.org](https://Brilliant.org) as your first step in any new terrain and also your way of cultivating a better way of thinking about math. 
   1. How to use Khan and Brilliant together? I personally suggest looking at khan first if you're new to math-- but instead of actually solving problems or watching video's just look at what topics there are and see what you're going to be doing next. For example, you might peruse khan academy and decide to start on Algebra 1. After that, switch over to [brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org) and do two things: 
      1. Go through the 'core' mathematical thinking courses. I'm talking the logic, problem solving, mathematical fundamentals, algebra fundamentals, geometry fundamentals, etc. 
      2. Look at which Brilliant course corresponds to the next piece you're going to do on Khan Academy. If that's algebra I, then you should observe that there is also an algebra 1 course on brilliant. Open that course up on brilliant, and check the pre-requisites. In this case it states that you should already have algebra fundamentals, so if you did those earlier-- you should be good to jump in. However, if you chose to start on Algebra 2 or Geometry on Khan Academy, you might open up some different pre-requisites and notice you haven't done them. At this point it's up to you if you want to do them on [Brilliant.org](https://Brilliant.org) if you've already learned those basic concepts in school or if you'd rather still do them. For me, I suggest doing them anyways. I took Algebra 1, Geometry and Algebra 2 in high school, but instead of going right to Trigonometry or Pre-Calculus I started with pre-algebra on brilliant and I do not regret it. There were some things I knew, yes, but I went through them quickly since unlike Khan Academy brilliant doesn't require 'mastery' but rather lets you self pace. So just solving the problems doesn't take very long if you truly know it-- then when you come across something you missed, forgot or simply never learned-- you'll have a chance to fill in the gaps. Additionally, [brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org) often teaches you things that your school didn't teach you (perhaps because its' too difficult for children, but technically \*should\* fit in with that course), so it's often worth at least skimming through courses you think you already know the content of. 
3. Use Wolfram Alpha only when you have tried to solve a problem multiple times, but are unable to do so-- or if you got marked wrong and didn't find the help on khan/brilliant very helpful and want a second look at the step by step process. Sometimes a different perspective helps a lot. 
4. 3Blue1Brown
   1. For this channel, I suggest just watching whatever happens to interest you. Once you get through the advanced maths though it's probably good to go through his calculus, linear algebra and differential equations series because he's more likely than not going to give you a new/fresh perspective on something. 
5. Crash Course Algebra
   1. This one isn't really necessary, but I did watch through the series on x2 speed before starting my [brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org/khan) / khan academy journey and I don't regret it. It was a good refresher and got me thinking about math in simple easy way. (I could watch it while half asleep in the morning, or late at night when I was getting tired, or I could watch it before work, etc. It doesn't require a lot of time per episode so it's not a bad thing to just casually go through. I even watched it while eating lunch a few times.)
6. Free Code Camp
   1. For this one, i'd say it's best if you already have a pretty strong idea of your math level, or if you want to review something you learned many years ago but don't want to spend a lot of time doing it. A normal Khan Academy course could take a pretty long amount of time, but if you have a free weekend you can plow through the entirety of a course using the Free Code Camp Youtube Math Video's."

[https://www.youtube.com/c/MathPhysicsEngineering](https://www.youtube.com/c/MathPhysicsEngineering)

My long-term goal is to create a channel with full courses of the full B. A curriculum in mathematics, on the highest level of the material and the quality of explanations. 

Your support will be of crucial importance and will make this goal of mine much more realistic. In the short term, I created various videos and in each of them 

(Except the playlist on Lego and Math Jokes) I transfer a real practical knowledge of mathematics or physics. The best playlist that I created so far is Panoramic view of linear algebra:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJfolPLC5tg&list=PLfbradAXv9x7nZBnh\_eqCqVwJzjFgTXu\_&ab\_channel=Math%2CPhysics%2CEngineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJfolPLC5tg&list=PLfbradAXv9x7nZBnh_eqCqVwJzjFgTXu_&ab_channel=Math%2CPhysics%2CEngineering)

&#x200B;

It gives the birds-eye view of the standard linear algebra course focusing on the difficult aspects of the course with detailed explanatioins and with very rigorous proofs.

I will let you be the judge on that. In addition, I have a playlist with hard integrals and challenging problems in analysis:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7EJ022eyg&list=PLfbradAXv9x4X06txBb6cJwayLUk0x6Ly&ab\_channel=Math%2CPhysics%2CEngineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7EJ022eyg&list=PLfbradAXv9x4X06txBb6cJwayLUk0x6Ly&ab_channel=Math%2CPhysics%2CEngineering)

&#x200B;

A playlist with the derivation of the formula for solving polynomial equations from order 2 up to 4:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpF\_wB\_lM9w&list=PLfbradAXv9x4glUD2eSw384pc4zsTbzHe&ab\_channel=Math%2CPhysics%2CEngineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpF_wB_lM9w&list=PLfbradAXv9x4glUD2eSw384pc4zsTbzHe&ab_channel=Math%2CPhysics%2CEngineering)

&#x200B;

A playlist on modeling and analyzing curves with desmos:

&#x200B;

Finally there is this playlist on the mathematics and physics of everyday life:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYAnW-LniPM&list=PLfbradAXv9x6IdTcC0USyDlXykDb92-\_c&ab\_channel=Math%2CPhysics%2CEngineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYAnW-LniPM&list=PLfbradAXv9x6IdTcC0USyDlXykDb92-_c&ab_channel=Math%2CPhysics%2CEngineering)

- https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/

It's a range of papers spanning a variety of different topics, from abstract algebra to analysis to number theory, and from mid-level undergraduate to intro graduate level.

These papers aren't really designed to be self-contained courses. Still, they're often *enormously* effective as supplementary material, either for self-study, for those who are taking formal classes, or as an after-the-fact reference.

To give some concrete examples, his papers

- [""Tensor products"" (57 pages)](https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/linmultialg/tensorprod.pdf)

 and

 [""Tensor products II"" (42 pages)](https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/linmultialg/tensorprod2.pdf)

I'm frequently informed of a number of frustrations experienced by both instructors and students when it comes to mathematics, thus I attempted to reconcile as many of these problems as possible to create short and easy to understand videos while still explaining everything step by step. 

These videos are done in a written explanation format as I am without hearing. Though this format might not work for learners who require a more detailed spoken explanation, it is my hope it can benefit students/teachers in other ways such as letting viewers go at their own pace depending on how quickly they read.

However, I am currently busy finishing my phD thesis, I can only answer about one question per week. I also cannot make very polished videos yet. All the videos I have right now are drafts- I'm practicing now and will launch the channel officially next year, when I have time to properly design a course, and also learn about video editing. Please do give me advice and feedback! I'd greatly appreciate it.

Personally, I have had friends who got depressed or quit math because they felt discouraged by the materials. I myself had also had long periods of struggles with many topics. Only when finally understood them did I see how that psychological torment was completely avoidable, had the materials been explained in a more motivated and intuitive way. That is why making this channel has been one of the top items in my bucket list. If you have any ideas of how I could make it more helpful for people, do let me know!"

[Megathread] Post your favorite (or your own) resources/channels/what have you.,"📢 Sharing a $1 math app I wrote recently for elementary school kids: Math Cats! 🐱📚  
  
Designed for elementary school kids and their parents, this app helps children practice grade 1 to 6 arithmetic they’ve already learned while making it easy for parents to track their progress!  
  
The idea came to me after spending a bunch of $$$ on math workbooks for my now 4th-grade daughter and never feeling satisfied:  
❌ Limited number of problems  
❌ Needing to manually grade answers  
❌ Constantly buying the next grade of workbooks…  
  
So, I created Math Cats to save parents time and money while hopefully keeping kids motivated to practice math!

Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,">if you have a base case k, then you can infer that k+1 also holds true

this is not what the teacher said. They said that if you prove the base case k and prove that the n case implies the n+1 case then the property is true for all n greater than or equal to k.

The keywords for the difference between what you learnt in philosophy and math are

""Inductive Reasoning"" (phil) and

""Mathematical Induction"" (math)"
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,"""induction"" in math does not mean the same as ""induction"" in science.  

Induction in math is the principle you describe, and it is logically sound.  

Induction in science is the completely different principle that, roughly stated, ""if something happens often enough without counter-examples, then it is reasonable to infer that it happens always"".  This is a true principle, but it's not a principle of logic.  

If you formulate the principle as a principle of logic, as ""If something happens enough times without counter-examples, then it is always true"" this is an unsound principle."
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,Succintly: mathematical induction is a form of \*deductive\* reasoning; it is not inductive in the philosophical sense that you're using.
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,"With induction, we prove that IF a statement is true for n, \*then\* it is also true for n+1. If this can be proven, it means the following:

Suppose you find a number k for which it is true. IT must then also be true for k+1. But if it's true for k+1, it must also be true for k+1+1, and so on."
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,"Pro tip:

If something widely accepted melts your brain, you are probably misunderstanding it"
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,"Despite its name, mathematical induction is actually a form of deductive reasoning instead of inductive reasoning.

Mathematical induction consists of two parts; proving the base case and proving that p+1 holds *given* p. Let’s call the base case p0. The second part showed that if p0 holds so do p0+1, which in turn showed that p0+2 holds, then p0+3, and so on. The ultimate result is that p0+n holds for all positive integer n."
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,"The thing you need to prove for mathematical induction is that if case k is true, then case k+1 must be true. This would be like proving that if the sun rose today, it must rise tomorrow. Then you just need to show that the sun rises on some arbitrary day 0, then it must rise the next day, and the next, and so on."
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,"In a proof by induction, you prove P(k)  ⇒ P(k+1), it's not ""well it's true for one k, so it's true for all k"".

The fact that it works is a consequence of the Peano axioms."
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,For a similar reason that induction is ok in Electrical Engineering.The word “induction” refers to different concepts in each case.
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,part of the inductive step is that you actually have to prove that p(x) is true implies that p(x+1) is true.  x is an even number doesn't imply x+1 is an even number.
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,"Well. First you show it holds for a base case. Then you show if it holds for any number, that the statement is going to hold for the successor. And this is the key. You are showing if it holds for arbitrary k, that implies it holds for k+1. And since you found such a k in your base case, you could loop through all the numbers and have it hold for any natural number.


Note the if then statement. ""IF it holds for some k, THEN it holds for k+1"" is the statement you must show.


Make sense?


The statement ""If the sun rises on day x, it will rise on day x+1"" is not generally true because there will be some day that the Earth is destroyed or flung out of orbit by a collision or something.


Example of induction:


Sum of natural numbers from 1 to n.


I will show it is n(n+1)/2. 


Base case: 1=1(1+1)/2.


Now suppose the formula holds for n.


Then 1+2+...+n=n(n+1)/2

So, 1+2+...+n+(n+1)=n(n+1)/2 +(n+1)


Make a common denominator and simplify.


You get (n^2 +n +2n +2)/2


Notice this factors into (n+1)(n+2)/2, which shows the original formula holds for n+1.


Now by the principle of mathematical induction, we may conclude the sum of natural numbers from 1 to n is n(n+1)/2."
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,"This is just my thinking, but the natural number 1 exists, and whenever you have a natural number, you can add 1 to that and get another natural number. So all the cases should be true. It's not the same as the sun rising tomorrow because that process is not guaranteed to continue indefinitely. But ""adding 1 to a natural number"" can continue indefinitely."
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,"The way an inductive proof would work by proving that a statement is true for a base case, and then proving that if it was true for the case n= k then it would hold for n=k+1, since the statement was already proved for some base case k then it is also true it is true for k+1 hence it is true for k=2…"
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,"They don’t work quite the same.


Mathematical inductions have you prove that P(k) -> P(k+1) is true, and prove a base case like P(1) is true. From here it follows for all natural numbers ( P(1) is true so P(1) -> P(2) is true, so P(2) is true, so P(2) -> P(3) is true, so … )


You aren’t taking anything on faith."
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,"You do not simply infer that if case k is true, then case k+1 is true. You need to *prove* that case k implies case k+1. Without first constructing that proof, you cannot proceed."
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,"> if you have a base case k, then you can infer that k+1 also holds true.

That's not what it says: Assume P(k) is true can you **show** P(k+1) is true. Is not what you wrote.

Mathematical induction is not the same as inductive logic. In mathematical induction you're looking at a finite steps of deductive reasoning to determine if P(k) is true for an infinite number of values. There is no probabilistic component as inductive reassoning has."
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,If k<= 42 then you can infer that k+1<=42?
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,"Naahh...  you weren't paying attention or someone grossly misspoke.

Mathematical induction requires that you ASSUME the case for k then show that this assumption implies that it must hold for k + 1. This is usually the hard part of the mathematical induction proof. 

You do NOT NEVER EVER INFER that it is true for k+1. This, as you note, make the proof rather meaningless. You must demonstrate that it must hold for k+1 if it holds for k."
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,"You are missing some of the nuance here.

Inductive proof work as follows:

1. A base case, prove the state is true for some 0 case.

2. Inductive step: Prove the statement  ""if the claim is true for the k case, then it is also true for the k+1 case""

If you can show both, that the claim is true for one case and you can show that ""given a case k, I can also assume k+1 is true"" then you have some your statement is true for n=0 implies it's true for n=1 implies it's true for n=2 and on and on.

That is the key. So you can't assume for every claim that because it has a base case it will be inductive (your example, because the sun rose today it will rise  tomorrow). But for a thing like that the sum of all positive integers from to n is n(n+1)/2, there is a way to prove if I take k(k+1)/2 is the sum up to k, it follows that the sum up to k±1 is (k+1)(k+2)/2.

The fallacy that the philosophers is describing is assuming the inductive step always holds (because it doesn't). The proof by induction is you show that in /this/ case, the inductive step is true (and that there is a base case that is also true)."
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,You'd be dead without that little fallacy.  Dead!
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,"The sun rising today is not proof that it will also rise tomorrow.

But the fact that 1) the sun rose today and 2) if the sun rises on any one day it also rises on the next day is sufficient to prove that it will rise on any day in the future.

That’s the whole point. Show that if a rule holds for case N it also holds for N+1, and shoe that it holds true for N=0 or any arbitrary starting point it holds for any N succeeding. Your philosophy analogy is basically only proving the N=0 case and applying it to all N which obviously is wrong"
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,"It's true that inductive reasoning is not certain: even if something has happened many times before, that doesn't mean it will happen again in the future. And, of course, in mathematics inductive reasoning is not acceptable.

Now, what you've seen, called ""proof by induction"", is named this way because it works similarly to induction in reality. But if we're rigurous, it's really a deductive process, not an inductive one.

I'm not going to be rigorous, but the idea of induction is that, if you have a property P, and you can deduce two things, namely:

1. This property is true for a ""base case"" (normally 0 or 1).
2. If it works for a number k, it works for k+1.

Then the property works for any case.

Now, what you're doing here is proving two different things. The base case is not ""k"", as you said; the base case will typically be a specific, fixed number. ""k"" is a general name for a number, and you want to prove that, if we assume it works for a number k, we can somehow deduce it works for k+1. So, the second proposition only means ""in the case it worked for 8, then it would necessarily work for 9, and if it works for 9, necessarily works for 10, and so on..."". But that's a ""if"". You don't know if it works for 8, 9 or 10. That's why you need the ""base case"".

Now, if you prove these two things. You'll be doing a deductive reasoning. Informally

1. If this property works for a number, it will work for the next one (remember, you need to deduce this from the definitions).
2. This property works for a specific number.

By these two premises, you can conclude that it will work for the number immediately after the number in premise 2. And repeating these deduction again and again, you'll be doing it for any number.

The difference with the induction that you saw as a fallacy is that, in reality, you can't prove the premise 1 (""it will work the next time""). In mathematics, however, this is possible because we restrict all events to what is given by the definitions."
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,Because the term induction has a different meaning in mathematics 
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,"""Much to my surprise, in math, if you have a base case k, then you can infer that k+1 also holds true.""

That's you're problem right there. That is NOT how mathematical induction works. Others have already replied and explained how it does work."
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,"""Induction"" means creating a generar rule out of observation of individual instances. 

In science this doesn't hold up, because all you need is one counter example to invalidate all the other instances where your observation was true, and *you can never know for sure that you have observed all possible situations/examples*.

In math, this is different, and it's actually called ""complete induction"". The word ""complete"" there is very important, because it shows that *you are actually indeed checking all the possibly examples* that exist. There will never be a counter example to disprove it."
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,"Mathematical induction and inductive reasoning are not the same thing. They just have a similar name for whatever reason.

So you assume that your proof will hold in the case that n = an arbitrary number k, and then you use that assumption to prove that your proof holds true for n = k + 1 (if your assumption is correct). So you've demonstrated that if your proof holds true for one number, it also holds true for the next number after that

Of course, k is a stand-in for an arbitrarily chosen number, so it can be any number at all. K + 1, therefore, can also be any number at all. So basically, if your proof holds true for n = any single number, it holds true for n = any number.

So now all you have to do is demonstrate that your proof holds true for any single number. 0 or 1 are nice, so you probably want to use one of those.

When you''ve demonstrated that your proof holds true for n = 0, then you can say ""well if it's true for n = k = 0, it's also true for n = k + 1 = 1. And if it's true for n = k = 1, it's also true for n = k + 1 = 2. And if it's true for n = k = 3...""

Ta-dah. No inductive reasoning has happened. Everything is probably, demonstrably true. The sun may not rise tomorrow, but a * b will still be equal to ab."
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,"The mathematical induction does not mean what it means in philosophy.

The mathematical induction is a formal logical argument and in philosophy, it would fall under ""deductive reasoning"" despite the name.

Induction works like this. Let's say you have propositions that you can order in a sequence {a\_n}. if a\_0 is true. and for any arbitrary n, a\_n logically implies a\_(n+1) (that is to say if a\_n is true, then a\_(n+1) is true), then all a\_n are true. Because if a\_0 is true, a\_0 implies a\_1, and you modus ponens to conclude a\_1 is true. then since a\_1 is true, and a\_1 implies a\_2, modus ponens a\_2 is true, and you can infinitely iterate like that."
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,"""Mathematical induction"" isn't what a (competent) philosopher would call ""inductive reasoning"". Mathematical induction is a *deductive* proof technique that happens to proceed by proving a base case, and then *proving* that the truth of the base case implies the truth of all other cases.

One does not simply *assume* that the case k implies k+1, one has to prove the implication P(k)⇒P(k+1).

Once you have a proof of P(k)⇒P(k+1), and a proof of P(0), then there are two possibilities:

1. If you are working in ZFC or an equivalent or stronger system, which is almost always the case, then it is already a theorem that (P(0) ∧ (P(k)⇒P(k+1))) ⇒ P(n) for all finite natural numbers `n`. (If you want to cover infinite values too, you need a third step, this is called transfinite induction, but this isn't normally needed.)

2. If you're working in a system too weak to prove induction as a theorem, such as PA or Presburger arithmetic, then induction may be an axiom of the system and therefore the truth of P(n) follows. But if there is no such axiom, and the system isn't able to prove induction as a theorem, then you're not allowed to use proofs by induction at all; for example Robinson arithmetic is essentially PA without induction."
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,"As others have stated it the key to your misunderstanding is the base case. You need the base case and the implication to be true.

Interestingly mathematical induction is stated as one of the main axioms in Peanos axioms which are used to formally define natural numbers."
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,"Mathematical induction is *deductive reasoning*.  It is *not* inductive reasoning.  They both just come from the Latin root: induct - ‘led into’.

In inductive reasoning, from previous instances of something being true, we're ""led into"" the conclusion that it will continue to be true.  Like, all attempts at falsifying this scientific hypothesis have failed, so we're led to conclude that it is most likely true.

In mathematical induction, the truth of the implication P(k) → P(k+1) along with the base case, P(1), means the truth of P(1) ""leads into"" the truth of P(2), and the truth of P(2) ""leads into"" the truth of P(3), and the truth of P(3) ""leads into""…etc.

Only reason ""mathematical induction"" and ""inductive reasoning"" sound similar is linguistic, but they are fundamentally very different."
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,">I took a course on classical logic for my philosophy minor. It was made abundantly clear that inductive reasoning is a fallacy.

I suspect that you misunderstood what your instructor was saying.  Inductive reasoning is *not* a fallacy.  It is simply different than deductive reasoning.  In deductive reasoning the conclusions are guaranteed from the premises if the premises are true.  In inductive reasoning the conclusions are at best probable if the premises are true.  Maybe you're remembering when your instructor said that it is a fallacy to conclude after an inductive argument that the conclusion is *guaranteed* to be true.  That doesn't mean inductive reasoning itself is fallacious just that one would be using it wrong.

If inductive reasoning was a fallacy then all of science would be a fallacy.  All of science basically goes like this:  we've tried to falsify this hypothesis many times and have failed therefore if we try to falsify it in the future we will most likely fail and hypothesis is then most likely true.  This is inductive reasoning."
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,"Different meanings of induction. 

To use your sun rising analogy, suppose we could reason that:

a) if the sun rises, it will also rise the next day
b) the sun rose today 

That would be enough to conclude that the sun will rise tomorrow. That’s similar to the case of mathematical induction where you assume k and use logic to deduce k+1. Here we are assuming k (which is b) and using logic (a) to deduce k+1 (sun rising tomorrow). That isn’t a fallacy. 

The fallacy of inductive reasoning in logic would be to just use (b) the conclude the sun will rise tomorrow, i.e. stating that because we see a trend we can expect it to continue. In order to use *mathematical* induction you need a mechanism for why the trend will continue."
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,It’s a domino effect. Let’s say you prove for the base case n=1. Then you assume for some arbitrary k it holds true and you prove that it’s true for k+1. So 1 being true infers 2 being true which infers 3 being true and so forth
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,"mathematical inducition is not inductive reasoning. it is just a bad coincidence that they are called the same.

but you can ddductively proove mathematical induction from math's axioms."
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,"“Inductive reasoning” is not the same as a “proof by induction”. They’re similar terms but they mean different things and I think this is what confuses you.

Inductive reasoning is like a deductive argument except you don’t get certainty. For example:-

- premise 1: Seneca was a Roman philosopher

- premise 2: Most Roman philosophers drank a lot of wine

- conclusion: Seneca drank a lot of wine

We take two claims which are assumed to be true (premises) and we reach a conclusion that would seem to follow. The reason this isn’t strictly valid is that when you make an inductive argument there’s always the possibility that your example doesn’t hold: maybe Seneca is one of the few Roman philosophers who didn’t drink wine. Crucially, inductive reasoning IS a valid way to make a philosophical argument, it’s just that inductive arguments can never reach certainty: they just make their conclusion seem more likely than if you didn’t make the argument.

But an inductive proof in the field of maths is something different. Mathematical induction works like this:

- we try to prove some property X holds for all of the members of some set S.

- we prove that X holds for at least one member of S.

- we show that if X holds for s in S, it also holds for the successor of s

- therefore we’ve proven that all members successive to s in S have property X.

That’s all quite wordy and technical, so let’s break it down with an example. I’m claiming that for every even number, either that number is a multiple of 4 or the next even number is a multiple of 4. I’ll call this property of either being a multiple of 4 or the next even number is a multiple of 4 “P” for property. 

Let’s look at 0. 0 is a multiple of 4, since we can write 0 as 0 x 4. Alternatively, we can say 0 / 4 has no remainder.

So P holds for s = 0.

Now we have to prove that in general if P holds for s it must also hold for the successor to s, which in this case is s + 2.

s is an even number, and P holds for it. If P holds for s, either s is a multiple of 4 or s + 2 is a multiple of 4. 

If s is a multiple of 4 then s + 4 is also a multiple of 4, which means that P must hold for s + 2 since the successor of s + 2 is s + 4 and s + 4 is a multiple of 4.

If s is not a multiple of 4 but P holds for s then s + 2 is a multiple of 4, which means P must also hold for s + 2.

And therefore the induction is complete! For any even number greater than or equal to 0, either that number is a multiple of 4 or the next even number is a multiple of 4. This is valid logic and it works essentially by proving two things:-

- if any even number is a multiple of 4 or the successor to a multiple of 4 then that even number’s successor is also either a multiple of 4 or the successor of a multiple of 4

- there is at least one even number which is either a multiple of 4 or the successor to a multiple of 4.

If these things are both true, it must follow logically that every even number is either a multiple of 4 or a successor to a multiple of 4."
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,"You prove these two things. You don't assume them, you deduce them and show that they are true.

1. Base case: It's definitely true for k = 1.
2. Induction step: IF it's true for some k, THEN that implies it's true for k + 1.

Taken together those establish the statement for all positive integers k. Why? Because you expicitly showed it's true for k = 1. And step 2 means that you can conclude it's true for k = 2.

But step 2 means that if it's true for k = 2, which it is, then it's true for k = 3.

And step 2 means that if it's true for k = 3, which it is, then it's true for k = 4.

I think you see where this is going. It's true for an arbitrary natural number k because there's a finite chain of implications leading from k = 1 to your arbitrary k, all of which you have PROVED are true."
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,"Inductive reasoning isn't fallacious, in fact it forms the basis for various hypothesis and scientific investigation. You can't always, in fact you usually can't, deduce everything in real life. You simply don't know enough, you use inductive reasoning to come up with conjectures you can test, then you test them. Based on the results of those test(s) you can start becoming more deductive because you know that general statements are factual - since you tested them. 

You are actually describing a basic inductive proof, or a 'domino' proof. Such a proof is only valid in certain conditions, but in those conditions it is quite valid."
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,">if you have a base case k, then you can infer that k+1 also holds true

did you pass the class?"
Why is inductive reasoning okay in math?,Because math isn't inherently just an observation. 1+1 will literally NEVER equal 3. But one day the sun WILL burn out.

How do I pass Engineering mathematics?,Take your time and practice as much as you can! You are definitely pass the maths courses
How do I pass Engineering mathematics?,"I don't know if it will help you, but try not thinking about math, think instead what it represents. At the uni I studied experimental physics and our professors where never satisfied with formula/equatio/etc, they always asked about physics behind. Treat math as a strange language, that describes everything around you. Like any other language it has rules, grammar, shortcuts etc, but in this case you can kinda reverse engineer some of it by actually observing.
Here an example from my uni days: we werre studying opamps and professor (RIP Prof. Shevchenko, after your classes I fell in love with electronics!) showed us how you can calculate feedback loops built with resistors. Aftewards he gave us a tip: you can treat any component or network of components in the loops as a resistor with some weird properties and replace your current/voltage operations with operators, that are appropriate for your components, i.e. to get voltage drop on capacitor instead of U=IR use U=1/c×∫Idt. After this lecture I never had any issues calculating even craziest feedback loops because I am just thinking about voltage drops and current flows in strange resistors, not about huge integro-differential equation.

At the end, you only need to understand nature of and know mathematical concept behind components and processes of the system you are describing - this way you can always look ath the result and ask yourself: will it work this way? And with time you will get better and better with math and your proböem will disappear"

Help with very simple real world math problem,"You want them to pay 25% more than you?

Let x be the amount you pay:

How to divide complex numbers,"For cases where the denominator is purely imaginary, it helps to know that

More generally, when you have a complex number with real and imaginary parts in the denominator, you want to multiply top and bottom by the conjugate of the denominator. This is very like rationalising surds/radicals in fractions, if that rings any bells. The trick is that if you have a complex number z, given by

> z = x + iy,

where x and y are real numbers, and define its conjugate to be

> z^c = x - iy,

then you calculate the product of these two to be

> |z|^2 := z z^c = x^2 + y^(2).

This is always a positive real number. Hence, multiplying top and bottom of the fraction by the conjugate of the denominator will remove all imaginary components from the denominator."

How to divide complex numbers,"You use the 'complex conjugate'.

So when you have a fraction you can multiply it by x/x and it won't change the equation.  For example:

What you want to do is to make the denominator in a complex number purely REAL (as in taking out the 'i').  If the denominator is real, then it's easy to divide, like so:

(4+2i)/2 = 2+i

The last idea (of a conjugate) works like so:

(x + y)(x - y) = x\^2 - + xy - xy - y\^2 = x\^2 - y\^2

The second term in the conjugate.  See how it only has squared variables in it?  Interesting...

Let's put it all together:

1/(x + i) = 1/(x + i) \* (x - i)/(x - i) = (x - i)/(x\^2 + 1)

Note that i\^2 = -1, so (x - i)(x + i) = x\^2 **+** 1, not x\^2 - 1.

How do you fit a cube perfectly into a square in an orthographic setting?,"Relative to a unit cube centered at the origin without rotation, if you want an approximate isometric perspective in pixel art style, where a flat square appears exactly half as tall as it is wide, the angles of camera rotation need to be: (**60°**, 0°, 45°)

You can then revisit the material (from textbooks or googling for resources online) and then attempt again, repeat until you can confident explain and teach the concept to others."
What is the best way for a person to study and master mathematics?,"Firstly, developing understanding \*also\* requires storing, organising and recalling information.

Secondly, learning and storing information long term requires engaging your brain, not just repetition. Practice primarily develops \*fluency\*. How and what you practice matters. It's entirely possible to train yourself to pattern match or fill in the blanks and follow recipes in the moment (e.g. a class room) without properly storing anything in long term memory, and with only limited understanding.

Developing understanding requires working with concepts and explanations: storing them in memory and relating them to each other. This may involve \*some\* repetition. It does not necessarily involve doing lots of exercises, though that may help if you \*also\* practice the explanations while doing the exercises (i.e. lay out all the working and justify every step), but you can just as easily fall into patterns doing that too.

* You can practice explaining concepts directly (e.g. practice teaching others). 
* You can even practice explaining recipes (as opposed to executing them).
* Notation matters. Practice explaining the same thing using:
   * natural language,
   * math notation,
   * pictures/diagrams.
* Don't take shortcuts unless the point is to learn the shortcut. 
* If you've stopped thinking then take breaks, go do other things, or mix in different concepts/exercises so you don't fall into patterns.
* Practice at different intervals (days, weeks, months, years) \*without\* looking at your notes (at least at first). Give yourself time to drop things from working memory so you can practice recalling them from long term memory.
* Organise the information in your notes to match how you imagine it should be organised in your brain (make summaries, mind maps, use colours, sing songs if you have to, etc).

Once an explanation for a concept is stored long-term and you can consistently apply it, look up alternative explanations/interpretations of that concept and learn those too. Compare the alternatives and try to reconcile them. 

This is a \*slow\* process. A single concept is merely an atom of understanding. You need to put them together with (or break them down into, or relate them to) other atoms to develop the whole picture. You may not feel like you've understood a concept until you've built an entire network of related concepts around it, and sometimes a new concept may upend the feeling that you ever understood something in the first place."

What is the best way for a person to study and master mathematics?,">Is it true that some people are just born with a ""math gene"" and are naturally good at it, while others struggle and feel like math isn’t for them?

This is not true for mathematics, or any field of study. The largest indicator of someone being proficient at a skill is time spent under deliberate practice."

What is the best way for a person to study and master mathematics?,Thank you all for your help. I’ll try to incorporate your advice into my study routine. I really appreciate the tips!
What is the best way for a person to study and master mathematics?,"They are correct. Just do it more and eventually you'll GET it... Hopefully. Unless you don't. 

There is no way to systematically create mathematical intuition. You either have it or you don't... If you don't, then you can at least improve to so so level. 

I'd suggest not just so problems and practice. There are much more materials out there these days. Watch YouTube videos on math challenges and explanation videos."
ELI5 how this green equation reduces or factors out as the blue equation.,"It depends on what your goal is when rewriting an expression. You mention the x distributing into the parentheses. That would resolve into (2x^(2)+2x)/(4x^(2)-4x), which is a perfectly valid way of writing the overall expression. This could then further resolve into (x^(2)+x)/(2x^(2)-2x), by the way. You could argue this form is a neater way to write it, but if it's more useful depends on what you plan to do with the expression after rewriting.

In some contexts, it might be better to write it in as many factors as possible, in which case it's beneficial to leave the x out of the parentheses and draw out any constants as well. That is exactly what is done here, they pulled a 2 out of the numerator and a 4 out of the denominator.

Edit: You mentioned the distributive properties in your post, this is using those same properties but backwards."
ELI5 how this green equation reduces or factors out as the blue equation.,"Pull the common factor of 2 out of the numerator parenthetical and the 4 out of the bottom (2x + 2) -> 2(x+1), etc. I would cancel one factor of 2 next ofc.

The reason why you don't factor the x into the parenthetical is that it makes it easier to see where the zeros in the numerator and denominator are. x = 0 and x = -1 for the numerator and x = 0 and x = +1 for the denominator. This lets you know where the function will go to zero or blow up at a glance.

Edit: You don't cancel this factor of x outside the parentheticals because then you would delete the important information about the function possibly being undefined at x = 0."
ELI5 how this green equation reduces or factors out as the blue equation.,"On the right hand side of the green you have

> x(2x+2) 

as the numerator. Note that

> 2x+2 = 2(x+1). 

If you can’t make sense of that, you need to brush up on distributivity and factoring. But if you can, then all they do to the numerator as they move from green to blue is take that factor of 2 out of (2x+2) and move it in front. 

> x(2x+2) = x[2(x+1)] = 2x(x+1). 

They do the same with a factor of 4 in the denominator.

**Edit to add**: you ask why the x on the outside doesn’t go *into* the bracket. 

***You could do that***. It’s true they could rewrite

> x(2x+2)

as 

> 2x^2 + 2x. 

But that wouldn’t be very helpful. The fact that

> a(b+c) = ab + ac

is a two way tool. You can either expand/multiply out the terms or you can factorise it to write it as a product of its factors. Which you choose to do should depend entirely on what’s more useful to you. Both are correct. In the case of this question, it’s more helpful to write it as a product of factors because - being a fraction - they can then cancel the common factors to reduce the expression down."
ELI5 how this green equation reduces or factors out as the blue equation.,They simply factor out the common factor in the terms in the parentheses. x(2x+2) = x(2(x+1)) = 2x(x+1). And similar in the denominator

I can't really grasp matrices (apologies if this is an overdone topic),"I recommend going to YouTube, looking up the channel 3blue1brown, and finding in his playlists tab “The Essence of Linear Algebra”. I feel like I learned more about matrices in that video series than I learned in a university-level course."
I can't really grasp matrices (apologies if this is an overdone topic),"each column corresponds to an input, each row to an output. So the product of two matrices requires ""wiring"" the outputs of one to the inputs of another, which is why you multiply rows and columns like that. This also explains the dimension thing, if one matrix has n inputs and m outputs, and another has m inputs and k outputs, the m outputs can be ""wired"" to the m inputs so now you have a matrix with n inputs and k outputs.

the ""multiply each combination of components"" thing you thought of is actually a thing called the tensor product, which is a generalization of objects like matrices and vectors to more complex types of function.

note: you can also say rows are inputs and columns are outputs, depends on if the smaller objects you're working with are column or row vectors."
I can't really grasp matrices (apologies if this is an overdone topic),"The way I look at it is: matrices are things that act on vectors. For example, one matrix might scale up all vectors by a factor of 2, while another might rotate vectors by a certain angle around a certain axis.

You've probably heard how 1 x n matrices are sometimes called ""column vectors."" If A is some random matrix and e\_1 is the column vector (1,0,0...,0) (which looks more like a row vector, but that's only because I can't draw a column vector easily on Reddit, so please pretend it's a column), then what is the product Ae\_1? If you look closely at the definition of matrix multiplication, you will discover that Ae\_1 is simply the first column of A. And if e\_2 is the column vector (0,1,0,...,0), then Ae\_2 is the second column of A, and so on. So the matrix A can be interpreted as a list of column vectors, specifically the column vectors that A maps e\_1, e\_2, ... e\_n to. Since any vector can be written as a linear combination of e\_1, e\_2, ...e\_n, knowing where A sends those vectors tells you where A sends any vector. Explicitly, if v=(v\_1,v\_2,... v\_n), then Av=v\_1Ae\_1+v\_2Ae\_2+...+v\_nAe\_n. So matrices are just compact representations of linear functions that take in a vector and output another vector. The height of a column is the length of the output vector, and the number of columns is the length of the input vector. Thus, a (b x a) matrix represents a function that takes as input a vector of length a and outputs a vector of length b. 

Now, what happens if we have two matrices A and B and a vector v, and we want to figure out what happens when we start with V, apply A, and then apply B. Well, we can first read off the first column of A, a.k.a. Ae\_1, and then compute what B does to that vector. That should be the first column of BA, since BAv should be the matrix that describes our process of applying A and then applying B. (In other words, we want (BA)v=B(Av), making multiplication associative). Work it out carefully and you will see that the matrix multiplication you've been taught is exactly the one that does this job. In particular, the height of A and the width of B have to be the same, because the output of the first function we're applying has to be a vector of the same length as the input of the second function.

This is all very abstract stuff, and I certainly haven't told you why we should care about matrices and vectors in the first place. So let me leave you with a concrete example. You probably know that 2-dimensional vectors of real numbers, e.g. (1,2.5), can be drawn as arrows in the 2D plane starting at the origin. One thing we can do with the 2D plane is rotate it around the origin clockwise by an angle t. From your knowledge of the unit circle, you may know that, if we start at the point (1,0) on the positive x-axis and rotate by t, we get to the point (cos(t) ,sin(t)). And, with a little more trig identity work and the knowledge that (0,1) is what you get by rotating (1,0) by pi/2, you can show that rotating by t sends (0,1) to (-sin(t),cos(t)). So, the matrix that represents ""rotate clockwise by t radians"" is just R\_t:=\[\[cos(t),-sin(t)\],\[sin(t),cos(t)\]\].

Now, what happens if I rotate clockwise by t radians, and then rotate clockwise by another s radians? Well, I've rotated by (s+t) radians in all, right? Based on this, we should expect that R\_sR\_t=R\_(s+t). And by using matrix multiplication and angle addition trig identities, one can check that this is the case."
I can't really grasp matrices (apologies if this is an overdone topic),"So the reason why the dimension turns into mxp is algorithmic.  the rule is you multiply the rows with the columns, and if you do that, the end result is an mxp. the inner dimenions of n no longer describe the shape of the new matrix. it's just that simple. 

  
the reason why you multiply first row by first column and iterate each column then row is because stone cold said so. that's just the rule we agreed on in the same way we just agreed that with 2x4 +3, you multiply first then add. it doesn't have to be that way. But that's the way everybody does and it makes life easier if we don't deviate from it. but if you're interested in that, I'm pretty sure somebody has done research on isomorphism between vector spaces with a different rule for multiplying matrices."
I can't really grasp matrices (apologies if this is an overdone topic),"its a list of vectors. matrix multiplication is the weighted sum of these vectors, with the weight being the vector the matrix is multiplying with. when you multiply matrix A with matrix B, its just that now each column of B is a different weight, so you get multiple weighted sum, and you stack these weighted sums together at the end to form a new matrix"
I can't really grasp matrices (apologies if this is an overdone topic),"There is an operation that does element by element multiplication. It's called the Hadamard product and it requires the matrices be the same size.

Introductory linear algebra or matrix-vector topics dont usually cover it. 

To get a more intuitive feel for matrix math, I recommend solving a 2x2 system.

y1 = a x1 + b x2

y2 = c x1 + d x2

Solve for x1 and x2 in terms of y1 and y2.

Matrix algebra generalizes this approach for systems with a lot more equations and variables and always guarenteed results to always have a solution given certain conditions.

Now after you have solved for x1 and x2. Reformulate the problem as a matrix.

( y1 ) = ( a   b )     ( x1 )

( y2 ) = ( c   d  )    ( x2 )

where you can write the matrix vector equations

y_dot = A x_dot

Using linear algebra notation you'll find

x_dot = A^(-1) y_dot

Youll find the elements of A^(-1) are the coefficiets for y1 and y2 in the equations that you found previously but linear algebra makes this easier.

One thing I want you to notice is the multiplication A x_dot is a row of matrix A multiplied by the column x_dot. Each row by each column gives you the original equations we started with.

A x_dot = ( a   b )     ( x1 ) = a x1 + b x2

                  ( c   d  )    ( x2 ) = c x1 + d x2

Notice that the dimensions of A are 2x2 and the dimensions of x_dot are 2x1 and they produce a new vector y with a dimension of 2x1.

The inner dimensions go away via the dot product between the row and column and collapse into a single element. 

A matrix of 2x2 multiplied by a vector of 2x1 because a vector of 2x1 where each element is generated by multiplying 2 numbers together and then adding them. 

A 3×3 matrix multiplied by a 3x1 vector would produce a 3x1 vector where each element is made of 3 numbers added together that are the result of two numbers (one from the matrix and one from the vector) multiplied."
I can't really grasp matrices (apologies if this is an overdone topic),"It is hard to explain because matrices have so many uses that going over them all is impossible. 

There is also a spectrum between purely mathematical explanations to purely practical ones.

I like to start in the middle with the statement that matrices are _transformations_. They are used to store transformations between (mathematical) vectors. What these transformations represent (are they geometrical, mechanical, some kind of operation, etc) it's up to you. As I said there are a lot of applications. 

The details of how they work as transformations in terms of how multiplication is defined isn't important to understanding their uses. 

What you need to know is that matrices form a closed algebra, with addition, and multiplication resulting in matrices.

And that `y = A x` means the matrix `A` is used for transforming a vector `x` to another vector `y`.

In terms of CS usually each vector represents a _state_ which contains all the information needed to describe a system, and matrices transform one state into another."

I can't really grasp matrices (apologies if this is an overdone topic),I made a video that motivates the definition in terms of linear maps. The relevant part is at 13:00. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBpbdeKOHA4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBpbdeKOHA4)
I can't really grasp matrices (apologies if this is an overdone topic),"I find that looking up practical uses is helpful. 

Vector math is pretty common in physics. There are matrix transforms in computer science and image processing."
I can't really grasp matrices (apologies if this is an overdone topic),So and this is a bit abstract it is a representation of a linear transformation from R^n to R^m and multiplication is composition which gives you a function from m dimensional space to n dimensional space.  Essentially when you multiply you're moving the basis vectors hence the composition via dot product of row i and column j. There is a form of product known as the Kronecker product which does multiply a_ij*b_ij but that's used to form what is known as a tensor.
I can't really grasp matrices (apologies if this is an overdone topic),"A lot of great explanations, but I want to give some more insight into use cases. 

Linear algebra is used to work with 3 (or more) dimensional space. We have found a lot of ways to model things this way, for example each column could be a datapoint and suddenly you're halfway to machine learning. In calculus of multiple variables linear algebra is used as the ground you stand on, putting variables into matrices. This leads into a multitude of applications in physics (like all of physics). Linear algebra also pops up in proofs in unrelated areas every now and again such as graph theory or combinatorics.

A lot of our computers are optimized for fast work on matrices, such as GPU's, it has pretty much become our standard way of dealing with math on large amounts of data, which is something some programmers will need to do so if you are interested in simulations, computer graphics, machine learning, high performance computing, etc then linear algebra is the most important math course you'll take."
I can't really grasp matrices (apologies if this is an overdone topic),"This is probably not the right answer for your particular needs, but from the perspective of pure mathematics, I think the way in which matrices are introduced is often really unmotivated, especially in linear algebra courses designed mainly for students from other disciplines (also it is not really true that their main applications are in programming - matrices, and more generally linear transformations, which they represent, are ubiquitous across all of mathematics and any discipline using it). 




The reason that matrix multiplication is the way it is is so that multiplication of matrices corresponds to composition of linear transformations (under a choice of bases). If you know what a linear transformation is, and what a basis is, Then you can sit down and write out what sort of operation you need in terms of vector components with respect to given bases to completely describe the algebra of linear transformations, and you will more or less automatically rederive the rule for matrix multiplication. This perspective is laid out especially nicely in Sheldon Axler's *Linear Algebra Done Right*."

7th grade math question wrong?,"for no value of x will -2\^x = 0. that means that h(x) has no x intercept. On the other hand, for -x\^2 + 4 = 0 is solved by x = +-2, just as well,  x+2 = 0 is solved by x = -2, these 2 functions are the only one that share an x intercept."
7th grade math question wrong?,"What do you calculate for the x-intercepts of f, g, and h? Remember x-intercept means the function output is 0, not x=0.


Did you notice Item 3 is going to negative infinity, not positive infinity?"
7th grade math question wrong?,"The x-intercept would be where the function crosses the x-axis, therefore it’s where y = 0. For both y = f(x) and y = g(x), that’s at x=-2. Same intercept. Why do you think it would be f(x) and h(x)? Hint: can h(x) even take on a value of 0?"
7th grade math question wrong?,"Notice that it's asking for an **x**-intercept.

f(x) crosses the x-axis at -2 and 2.  
g(x) crosses the x-axis at -2.  
h(x) does not cross the x-axis at all.

So the program has scored this correctly.

Why do you think otherwise?"
7th grade math question wrong?,"there is no error, the program is correct in both cases.

for the first, f has x intercepts at 2 and -2, g at -2, and h nowhere. the only value that is shared between two functions is -2 for f and g.

for the second, K goes to infinity, P goes to 0, and D and K both go to -infinity, but N does so at a faster rate because it's a degree 2 polynomial while D is only degree 1. so for large negative values of x, N will always be less than the others."
7th grade math question wrong?,"For item 3: Function D is positive for all negative values of x. Function K is an upward parabola so it does have negative values of y but not that many; it stops at some point. And generally, as x tends towards negative infinity function K will be positive.  Function N is a downward parabola so it does have positive y values but not that many; it stops at some point. And generally, as x tends towards negative infinity, function N will be negative. This is the same reasoning used for function K. Lastly, Function P will just get closer to 0 as x tends towards negative infinity. This is because when you have a negative exponent it turns into a fraction (i.e: 2^-x = 1/(2^x)). So as to e answer would be function N as it is the only one that tends towards negative values as x tends towards negative infinity."
7th grade math question wrong?,"For photo 1, find the intercepts. f&g share one.

It is easiest to start with g, since it is obvious that g(-2)=0. Plug that x=-2 into the other functions and see what you get. You'll find that f(-2)=0 as well.

\---

For photo 2, I can see the issue. I think it meant the 'most negative'/'least positive'. 

e.g. -1 billion is less than -0.0001.

You could argue that your sister's answer could be correct for 'smallest', and that maybe the question should have said ""lowest"" if it wanted you to answer N"
7th grade math question wrong?,"The 3rd one is en exponential (the x is in exponent). Exponential functions don't have x intercepts anywhere, so it has to be the other 2."
7th grade math question wrong?,"h(x) doesn’t have an x-intercept, g(x) has one, and f(x) has two, one of which it shares with g(x). This is a poorly-phrased question."
7th grade math question wrong?,"Interesting that the concept of functions is taught at g7. 

I would’ve taught this same concept using y= and sidestepped the whole issue of functions."

linear algebra
calculus
probability and stats
some optimization theory

but most ml jobs don’t even go that deep
they care more if you can think critically and solve real problems using those tools

Bad news - this is probably grade 4.  Many people start having issues around there, which has fractions.  Good news - this is fixable, as long as you're willing to do a lot of math.  Also remember, math is learned by DOING, not by following along, so you'll be DOING the math, which means solving problems.

Go to Khan Academy.  Go to Grade 4. Do the Course Challenge TWICE in a row.  Anything you don't confidently, easily ace, go back and do the entire unit to 100%.  After that is done, Course Challenge again and move on to Grade 5.  Keep on going one grade at a time until you get where you are (and a little ahead).

Khan is good for an overview.  It isn't good for high practice volume, so also go online and get worksheets and question banks.  Many free ones exist.  If you want to be a math star, you can use the free Alcumus program once you're finished Pre-Algebra, but be aware that the questions are quite hard and while they will really improve your math skills, they are only for when you've already gotten 100% on Pre-Algebra in Khan.

Also download a mental math app to improve your number sense, and use it daily for a few minutes.

how do mathematicians come up with useful patterns and formulas?,"You're approaching it somewhat backward.  Typically, people have a problem they're trying to solve, they notice that there's a pattern, they codify it, they prepare some sort of proof that it does what they think it does.

They don't just sit there running through patterns of numbers and ask ""is this one useful?  How about this one?"".

But there are many many useful and insightful integer sequences, [there's even a book of them](https://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Integer-Sequences-N-Sloane/dp/0125586302)."
how do mathematicians come up with useful patterns and formulas?,"Useful mathematical formulae come with proofs which are logical arguments as to why they are true.

sometimes they play around with math objects and years later someone else uses their results for a problem

in general the entire idea that mathematicians ask themselves ""is this useful?"" is misguided as mathematicians do math for the sake of itself"
how do mathematicians come up with useful patterns and formulas?,"The word ""useful"" is doing a lot of work there. 

Thinking and reasoning and creating mathematical problems are not done because they are necessarily ""useful"". Many of them are ideas (like you describe in your post) and then thinking of the approach and potential methods to solve them. This is ""useful"" to the mathematician. It is like a puzzle to solve. It may not be ""useful"" to anyone else.

how do mathematicians come up with useful patterns and formulas?,"This seems to be a common conceptual question on these subreddits.

As someone once said to me, the question is: Does this lead to interesting mathematics, or not? What that means to a mathematician is, can I prove something interesting about this? If every question I can think to ask about this has a simple or easy answer, then it's probably not ""interesting.""

So in your case, if you are inventing sequences, then you want to find a question about it that leads to an interesting answer. The question is up to you to find. With the Collatz conjecture, the obvious question is, does this sequence always lead to a specific loop? For your sequence it might be ""what is the asymptotic behavior"", but I fear that question may not be very compelling. For the dice counting sequence you mentioned, the problem there is that it's too easy to write down what the n-th term in the series is. Once you've got a closed formula, that often puts to rest a lot of questions you could ask.

At the end of the day, it's up to the person inventing to thing (sequence, map, definition, so on) to provide compelling questions and, hopefully, some compelling answers. If you can't think of how this relates to other areas of math or can't think of anything interesting to prove, then the object may just be one in an endless sea of other objects."

Solving quadratic equations by factoring,"The author is doing this subconsciously, actually, I would do the exact same thing.

Solving 16t\^2 - 160t + 256 = 0 is logically equivalent to -16t\^2 + 160t - 256 = 0 and both require you to move terms over. It requires less mental memory for (presumably) most people to work with positive values for t\^2 when factoring. Thus, the author automatically solves the former."

conjugate group theory,"something like that, depending on how you interpret the wording… 

you can evaluate the conjugate aba^(-1) quickly by taking the cycles of b and replacing each x with a(x).

so for example if b = (1,5)(2,4,7,6) and a = (1,3,5,7,2,4,6) then aba^(-1) = (3,7)(4,6,2,1)."
conjugate group theory,"Think of b in terms of the cycles it decomposes into. If you do a-¹ba, you're acting on your set with a, then do b, then undo what a did. Where does an a-¹(x) go? It goes to x then to b(x) then a-¹(b(x)). If you know there is a cycle XYZ, then you know you have a cycle a-1(x)a-¹(y)a-¹(z), since you indeed know that a-¹(x) goes to a-¹(y) and so on.

So you can replace the cycles in b with a-¹ applied to it's elements."
conjugate group theory,"ChatGPT is almost right, but not quite: you should take a^(-1)(x):

a^(-1)ba(a^(-1)(x))=a^(-1)b(x).

so a^(-1)ba takes a^(-1)(x) to a^(-1)(b(x)). If you are writing b in cycle notation you can just represent this just by replacing each x with a^(-1)(x) in the cycle notation.

If you write the conjugation as aba^(-1) (so rename a as a^(-1)) then you can replace them with a(x), which is maybe the more intuitive way to look at it.

To understand this intuitively, think of a as just being a “renaming” of the elements b is acting on, then a^(-1)ba just means “change the names, apply b then ‘translate’ back”. So a^(-1)ba can be thought of as the “same” permutation as b but with the roles of the elements switched around according to the rule given by a.

The basic idea is maybe even easier to understand if you start by letting a be a bijection between two *different* sets, and see how you can use a to “transport” a permutation b on one of those sets to the other. Then once you understand that realize that the reasoning works the same if the two “different” sets are actually the same set."

Struggling with a fairly simple math question,"""1"" is just one representation of the concept.

Struggling with a fairly simple math question,"It sounds like you understand how to do addition of fractions with different denominators. Do you understand how to do subtraction of fractions with different denominators?

If so, then there’s a very easy trick you can use here. For any whole number, you can just write it as a fraction—i.e. replace 2 with 2/1, or replace 19 with  19/1. In this case, you would turn the problem “1 - 7/12” into “1/1 - 7/12”. This will let you turn the problem into a form that you may be more familiar with."
Struggling with a fairly simple math question,"So, first, all rational/normal numbers can be written as a fraction. 1 can be written as 1/1, 2/2 etc, so for each Integer/whole number, 1 = n/n.

So to make it as simple as possible you can write 1=12/12. This way you can write the final question as (12-7)/12 = 5/12.

The more complicated part is dealing with 1/3 + 1/4 (from earlier). What we need is to make them have the same denominator, so that we can write the 1s together at the top as we did before. That is, we need to somehow make them have the same denominator, and also change the number on top so that the value individually (when written as decimal) doesn't change. 

To do this we need some trickery. If we take the 1/3 and we want to make the denominator bigger, we can for example take (2* 1)/(2* 3) = 2/6. Both numbers have increased proportionally. We could now, without it helping us yet, write 2/6 + 1/4, and it is the same thing.

Now that we know this trick, we can do something clever. We should have nice we want 3 and 4 (the denominators) to become the same number, we could multiply them together, so 3* 4 = 12, as is 4* 3 =12.

Now we still need to keep the top proportional, so since we multiply the 3 in 1/3 by 4, we must multiply the 1 by 4 too. (4* 1)/(4* 3) = 4/12. We do the same with 1/4, but multiply it by 3, giving us 3/12. In the end we have 4/12 + 3/12 = (4+3)/12.

Now, the 1 represents the entirety, note that 1/3 and 1/4 are less than 1. We can e.g consider 1 to be 100%, that is the 100 per hundred, I.e 100/100. In this case the one is a dozen per dozen, I.e 12/12. John could have spent more than 100% of his salary too."
Struggling with a fairly simple math question,"If you have twelve of something, and you get rid of seven of them (in this case by spending), you have five left. That's all that line is saying.

The question doesn't ask you to subtract a whole number from a fraction. It's the other way round: you have to subtract a fraction (7/12) from a whole (1)"
Struggling with a fairly simple math question,"> why are we using that number 1

Before he spends anything, John has 100% of his pay. 100% as a fraction is just 100/100, which is just 1. So the 1 represents all of John’s pay. 

> How do you subtract a fraction from a whole number

In this case, you realize that 1 can be written as 12/12, which makes it easy to subtract 7/12."

- left of p = all of p minus (1/3 of p) minus (1/4 of p)
- left of p = 1 x p – 1/3 x p – 1/4 x p
- left of p = (1 – 1/3 – 1/4) x p
- left of p = (1 – (1/3 + 1/4)) x p
- left of p = (1 – (4/12 + 3/12)) x p
- left of p = (1 – (4+3)/12) x p
- left of p = (1 – 7/12) x p
- left of p = (12/12 – 7/12) x p
- left of p = (12 – 7)/12 x p
- left of p = 5/12 x p

Where does the 1- come from in this limit proof?,"The initial algebra gives you bounds on |x|, when you need bounds on x-1. You need delta chosen so that -delta < x-1 < 0 guarantees the bound on the function.

learning complex numbers,"> I know x is real and y is imaginary

Not in this context, no. You may be thinking of how we can visualize a complex number as point on a 2D plane; in that context it is common to see ""x + iy"" with x real and y also real (so yi is pure imaginary). But based on your two equations I can tell you for sure that x is not going to be a real number.

> how would i figure this out?

Exactly the same way you would solve something like ""3x + 8x = 7, 4x - y = 10"". You could use

* substitution
* elimination (with equations)
* Gaussian elimination (with matrices)
* Cramer's rule

or even some other methods. They all work just as well with complex numbers as they do with real numbers (you just need to be able to divide complex numbers).

---

If you want to use elimination, first eliminating y, then you could multiply the top equation by 3 and the bottom equation by 1+i.

(1+i)(3-i) x - (1+i)3y = (1+i)(1-10i)

3·2x + 3(1+i)y = 3(1-3i)

becomes

(4+2i) x - (3+3i)y = 11-9i

6x + (3+3i)y = 3-9i

and adding those two equations gives

(10+2i)x + **0y** = 11-9i + 3-9i = 14-18i

so you can solve that for x (you should get x = (14-18i)/(10+2i) = >!1-2i!<). After you know x, you can use either equation to get y = >!just i!<.

---

> can i maybe split them

Yes, that is also an option. Your systems with 2 complex unknowns could be thought of a system with 4 real unknowns. Using

x = a + b i

y = c + d i

the system becomes

(3-i)(a+bi) - 3(c+di) = 1-10i

→ (3 a + b - 3 c) + (-a + 3 b - 3 d)i = 1 - 10i 

2(a+bi) + (1+i)(c+di) = 1-3i

→ (2 a + c - d) + (2 b + c + d)i = 1 - 3i,

so you could use the *real* system

    3a +  b - 3c      = 1
    -a + 3b      - 3d = -10
    2a +       c - d  = 1
         2b  + c + d  = -3

instead. The solution there is >!a = 1, b = -2, c = 0, d = 1!<, which again means that x = a+bi = >!1-2i!< and y = c+di = >!0+i = i!<."
learning complex numbers,"You should be able to use all the same techniques you would use when the coefficients are real numbers: substitution, Gaussian Elimination, inverse matrices, Cramers Rule (shudders at the computational complexity).  Any of them should work, you'll just need to follow through on the arithmetic with complex numbers."
learning complex numbers,"Are you sure about x and y being real and imaginary respectively? Like, is that stated explicitly in the question? I’ve not done the computation for this yet, but that sounds like an unnecessary assumption. 

If I gave you a pair of simultaneous linear equations:

- 3a + b = 9
- a - 2b = -5

Then you’d probably be able to solve that, right? You have a method (be that Gaussian elimination, substitution, or something more like matrix algebra’s Gauss Jordan process). Well, you now have complex coefficients in front of the variables instead of real/integer ones, but that doesn’t change the process!

In your case, you will want to be comfortable multiplying and dividing by complex numbers (but this is easy if you know how). The rest is the same kind of process as before. 

The simplest process for you in this problem is probably to:

- divide the second equation by 2, and rearrange so you get x by itself on one side, and an expression containing y on the other. 
- substitute that expression in for x in the first equation and then solve for y. 
- use that value for y to get a value for x back from your second equation. 

Does that make sense?"
learning complex numbers,"Gaussian Elimination Works, also substitution. Just treat j as a constant"
learning complex numbers,"Multiply top by -2

Button by (3-i)

Add straight down

Profit"
learning complex numbers,"just solve them like you’d solve real simultaneous equations literally everything still holds true, although im fairly sure x is complex and y is also complex rather than one being purely real and the other purely imaginary"
learning complex numbers,"there is nothing different than treating it as the case for reals

i heard u mentioned “split them” maybe u meant because it has both Re and Im parts u think it introduced more variables

but calm down, the right side also has Re and Im parts, which made the system 4 unknowns, 4 equations, which is a slower way but still works"

Funzioni and equation,"Make it more general:

Solve 6x+9=4x+1

The solution is the x-coordinate of the intersection of the graphs of the functions

h(x)=f(x)-g(x)=6x+9-(4x+1)

Why is division so prevalent in finite group theory?,I would argue that since a group has only one operation factorization is pretty much the only thing you can do with a group (there are deeper structure theorems but they are motivated by a different kind of questions).
Why is division so prevalent in finite group theory?,"I'm currently taking Abstract Algebra for the first time as well, but from what I understand, we care about things like division because groups can be thought of as the union of their subgroups and understanding the structure of a group's smaller parts can be insightful about other properties or extend to other theorems

For instance, I believe the Fundamental Homomorphism Theorem describes how a group, its quotient/factor group based on the kernel of the homomorphism, and normal subgroups are interrelated (I'm still learning this so bear with me here lol). 

If I understand correctly, we can see that the kernel of the homomorphism is a normal subgroup from G of a group homomorphism phi: G -> G' and the factor group created by G/(ker(phi)) is isomorphic to the image of phi, which is a subgroup of G'"
Why is division so prevalent in finite group theory?,"You are working a lot with natural numbers and one of the fundamental ways to understand natural numbers are divisors. What you often do is consider that a^(n)=e, for a a group element, n a natural number and e the identity. Now if n=c\*d, you could look at a^(n)=(a^(d))^c and if a^d has some nice properties. Then you have group actions, group actions partition the set you are acting on. What happens in certain cases (e.g. Lagrange's theorem) is that this partition are sets of the same size, so you have a kind of elementary school kind of notion of division."
Why is division so prevalent in finite group theory?,"I do think finite group theory is a little bit unique in the grand scheme of things because of its highly combinatorial nature. So if you mean factorization in terms of “counting” aspects, perhaps you won’t find this in many highly general subjects. But of course there are infinite groups as well, which are just as if not more important. But if you mean taking quotients, then this applies to almost every subject in math."
Why is division so prevalent in finite group theory?,"The motivation of groups was solvability in Galois theory,  which you’ll likely get to towards the end of your group theory course. Solvability looks at the normal subgroup structure and makes assertions based on that structure, hence any tools that help us compute or determine what that subgroup structure looks like is immediately useful."
Why is division so prevalent in finite group theory?,Factorization is important when it comes to morphisms between groups or spaces. And the morphisms are very important in Differential Geometry for example and by extended in physics.
Why is division so prevalent in finite group theory?,"I think it comes down, in some way, to cosets and cancellation. 

Maybe the other perspective that's useful is actions. We basically came up with groups from the perspective of groups acting on sets. The set of elements that fix (or stabilize) some element x is a subgroup (lets call it H). And then you can ask what elements move x to another element y. And if that set of elements is non-empty, it's some coset of H. And cosets are (a) disjoint and (b) the same size. This is sort of the fundamental thing that makes divisibility so important in groups. Any subgroup, the group is the union of some number of cosets, all the same size as that subgroup. And subgroups are these very natural things that come up from asking what elements ina group preserve some extra property when they act on soemthing"

I don't understand the speed/distance/time calculation,"To calculate speed, just remember the simple formula: Speed = Distance ÷ Time. That means how fast something is going depends on how far it travels and how long it takes. If you know the distance and the time, divide the distance by the time to get the speed. Also remember to use the right units. If the distance was in kilometers and the time in hours, you get a speed in kilometers per hour, or if the distance was in miles and the time in days, you get a speed of miles per day."
I don't understand the speed/distance/time calculation,"Speed, basically, is just a number denoting how much distance you cover in how much time.

I don't understand the speed/distance/time calculation,"Speed, distance and time have the symbol v, s and t. You can remember them as Velocity (usually taken for vector rather than scalars), Spacial distance and Time.

The general formula is v=s/t mean velocity has the unit [m/s] (meter per second, so distance over time). Sometimes you need to consider what the unit actually looks like.
For example, you can use kilometre for distance or hours for time. If one or two of the variable of v, s and/or t has a different unit you need to convert them.

Example: What is the velocity in [m/s] if you have traveled a distance of 3km in 30min? So, the units of v is m/s, but s is not in meter and time is not in seconds. Therefore convert both into to the desired units. s=3000m (the “k”=kilo=1000). t=1.800s=30min*(60s/1min), min cancels out and 60s/1min is the conversion term between seconds and minutes. So, the final equation for v is: v=3000m/1800s=1,667m/s"
I don't understand the speed/distance/time calculation,"s = d / t

Let's say we have a race.

The winner has the highest speed.

When the winner wins, the other racers haven't yet got to the finish line. At that time, they have less distance. A smaller numerator makes a smaller speed.

If we wait until all racers finish, they have all run the same distance, but the winner has the smallest time. A small denominator makes a larger speed. E.g., if you divide something by 2, you get a bigger result than if you divide it by 3.

Other forms of the equation, like d = s * t can be gotten by basic algebra (multiply or divide both sides by the same variable and cancel matching terms in the numerator and denominator)."
I don't understand the speed/distance/time calculation,"What don’t you understand? To test how much you already know, here’s a basic statement: 

You can travel 6 miles in 2 hours at 3 miles per hour.

Try completing it logically with each variable removed:

You can travel ? miles in 2 hours at 3 miles per hour.

You can travel 6 miles in ? hours at 3 miles per hour.

You can travel 6 miles in 2 hours at ? miles per hour."
I don't understand the speed/distance/time calculation,"\> I'm taking an important exam soon and I can't calculate the speed at all...

Speed is distance per unit of time. The faster you travel, the more distance you cover in a unit of time. Distance is expressed in some unit of length, like feet, meters, miles, or kilometers. I'm sure you're familiar with units of time: hours, minutes, or seconds.

At any moment when you're moving, you're moving at some speed. If you're walking along the sidewalk, you might be moving at 3 mph, which means 3 miles/hour. In other words, if you kept moving at that same speed for 1 hour, you'd cover 3 miles. If you're traveling in a car on a highway, you might be moving at a speed of 105 kph, also written 105 km/h. If you traveled at that speed for 3 hours, you'd cover 105 km in the first hour, another 105 km in the second hour, and 105 km in the third hour, for a total of 3 \* 105 km, or 315 km total. If you only traveled at that speed for 10 minutes, which is 1/6 hour, you'd travel 105 km/h \* 1/6 h = 17.5 km.

Here's the equation that you need to know:

v = d/t

where v is speed (velocity, really), d is distance, and t is time. You can rearrange those terms to solve for any of the three variables if you know the other two, using the rules of algebra. In other words, whatever you do to one side the of the equation, you have to also do to the other side. If you want to solve for distance, multiply both sides by time to get vt = d. If you want to solve for time, multiply both sides by time and divide both sides by distance to get t = d/v.

So, if you board a train and travel 435 km and the trip takes 3.5 hours, how fast was the train moving? Use v = d/t: you know the distance and time, so speed v = 435 km / 3.5 h = 124.29 km/h. If you take a ferry a distance of 20 km and the ferry travels at a speed of 15 km/h, how long does the trip take? t = d/v, so t = 20 km / 15 km/h = 0.67 h.

One thing that you should pay attention to is the units. Ideally you'll want to stick with the same units throughout a problem; otherwise you'll need to convert units. If you need to do that, realize that units can cancel out the same way numbers do when you're using fractions. For example, if you want to convert miles per minute to feet per second, you just create appropriate conversion factors and multiply them into your calculation. If you ride a bicycle 3 miles in 20 minutes, what was your speed in feet per second?

3 miles / 20 minutes = 0.15 miles/minute

0.15 miles/minute \* (5280 feet / 1 mile) = 792 feet/minute

792 feet/minute \* (1 minute / 60 seconds) = 13.2 feet/second

Notice that the conversion factors are set up to make the units that you want to change cancel out, and the quantities in the conversion factor are set so that numerator and denominator are equivalent amounts: there are 5280 feet in 1 mile, so multiplying a distance by 5280 feet / 1 mile doesn't change the actual distance, it only changes the units the distance is expressed in."

I don't understand the speed/distance/time calculation,"Speed is just distance divided by time. Do you know how to do division?

*addition* is a kind of *operation*, which combines two things to result in another thing. addition exists, specifically it has a property called being *well-defined*: any time you do the same addition, you get the same result. for example “1 plus 1 is 2, and also 1 plus 1 is 2”. a useful shorthand is a cross +.

*subtraction* is also a well-defined operation. it is the *inverse* (“opposite”) of addition, meaning its result is the thing you have to add, i.e. exactly when “a plus b is c” then “c minus a is b”. a useful shorthand is a dash –.

x is a name. the answer to “what is x?” starts with “x is…”

putting all of these things together, you can use the information that 4 minus x is 3 to find out what x is. the idea is that “x is…” is the shortest possible sentence, so move towards it by using inverse operations to say progressively shorter sentences. of course there are no better or worse ways to do this. think of it like walking to the shops. it doesn’t matter *when* you cross the road… just go to where the shops are. i’ll just use the way written in the post as an example. 

4 - x = 3  
(4 - x) - 3 = 3 - 3  
1 - x = 0  
this step is true because subtraction is a well-defined operation. this step is useful because it reduces the amount of known numbers in the sentence from two to one (having only 0 on one side acts like there’s “nothing” there). (it’s so useful that schools teach a name for it: “collecting like terms”.) 

1 - x = 0  
(1 - x) + x = 0 + x  
1 = x  
x = 1  
this step is true because addition is a well-defined operation. this step results in the answer “x is 1”."
Basic algebra - why does this work?,"You'll often know the answer a few steps before you write it out, and in later math coursed writing the +x of whatever won't even be required.

The point is to have a simple expression such as x=1. 

If the question is ""solve for x"", and you have an expression such as 1-x=0, you need to isolate x so that we know exactly what x equals.

In more complex problems such as x²-3=0, we get x²=3, take the square root of both sides, and we get x=±root3 

Before you would have questions like 5+7= blank, now instead of a blank were replacing it with x. So imagine it's 5+7=x, you already have x isolated you just need to simplify here. In algebra the answer location, or x in this example is different. So we could rearrange the formula to 7=x-5 and it's the exact same problem. But since you want to solve for x, we have to move everything to one side to get the solution for x."
Basic algebra - why does this work?,">2nd line - we already know that x must be 1 since 1 - 1 = 0

Indeed, but what if it wasn't that obvious? Take for example:

x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = -336

By the same logic we could say ""well obviously x must be -5 since (-5)^3 - 6(-5)^2 + 11(-5) - 6 = - 336"". But that's not really obvious, is it? I know it just because I constructed the equation by working backwards from the solution, but if I hadn't I would need to use some more sophisticated techniques than ""well clearly it's obvious"" to work out the solution.

So where between this and 1 - x = 0 should we draw the line between what's ""obvious"" and what's not? What if it's obvious to a university professor but not a high school student? The conventional answer is: only when x is completely isolated on one side can we truly say that it's unquestionably obvious. If someone asks you ""what length should I cut this plank"" you don't answer ""cut it to length x where 2x + 30 cm = 150 cm"", you answer ""60 cm please"". The former is just as _correct_ and unambiguous, but you'd come across as a jerk.

And isolating x is kind of what you're doing already when you say ""we already know that x must be 1"": you're skipping ahead to the solution x = 1 because you're familiar enough with basic arithmetic to see the solution before you've written it out explicitly."
Basic algebra - why does this work?,"This must have something to do with the fact that equality on the real numbers is an equivalence relation and that this relation is compatible with addition. So if x=x' and y=y' then x+y=x'+y'. In the question y=-3 and y'=-3 which by transitivity of the equivalence relation gives y=y'.

Finally, solving an equation means determining a set of solutions by a relation for which we seek to write equivalent relations.
{x such that f(x)=g(x}
By equivalence if we arrive at 3=3 we obtain a set of solutions which correspond to the starting domain. If we arrive at 5=6 we obtain the empty set. The relation x=7 corresponds to the singleton {7}"
Basic algebra - why does this work?,"Algebra by definition is the moving of terms to the other side of the equals sign.


1-x=0 doesn't show x=1. It just shows that you can guess x has to be 1 for the equation to work. Moving x to the other side shows  definitely that x=1, using literal algebra steps. "
Basic algebra - why does this work?,"When you write 1 - x = 0, you might intuit that x = 1. Anybody who knows algebra can tell you that x = 1 just by looking at that equation. But for it to be mathematically rigorous, you need to show the step that explicitly shows x = 1. Depending on the level of math you are learning, your teacher may want you to be mathematically rigorous and show all steps. In higher levels of math, where knowledge of algebra is assumed and used as a tool, you can generally skip a lot of these middle steps and just say 4 - × = 3, therefore x = 1."
Basic algebra - why does this work?,It's because to solve an equation we have to end up with a variable equal to a value. We don't arrive at the step before and then say 'so that's the answer because we can just see it is' any more than a sprinter stops 10m before the line and announces 'well you can just see I would have won'. Finish the job.
Basic algebra - why does this work?,"Yes, looking at 1- x= 0 most people will see that x must be one.  but by adding x to both sides we get an equation, x= 1, that SAYS that x is 1."

It took me years to be the person on the right side. And yes, I’m about that silly when it comes to practice. There comes a point when you’re not thinking about what you need to do, you’re just doing it, and doing it because it’s fun makes it all the better.

For me it was about making a schedule that I could work on things consistently. After a while it’s natural to the point that something feels off if you miss a day.

So don’t overwhelm yourself too much. Just watch a math video or do a problem, or read a text. Try to do one small thing everyday. And have fun!"
how do i actually get good at math,"math isn’t just about memorizing rules, it’s about learning how to think with them and the skill you’re struggling with isn’t knowledge it’s flexibility being able to take what you know and bend it around a weird new problem without freaking out

what helps is doing practice that’s not just repetitive drills but stuff that actually forces you to figure out why something works and how to build connections

try this kinda rhythm when you’re learning something new:

read or watch it once
then close your notes and try explaining it to yourself in your own words like you’re teaching it
then try solving a type of problem without looking at examples first
if you get stuck, don’t give up yet instead ask yourself: what tools do i have in my math toolbox and what am i being asked to find

this is how you train your brain to think like a puzzle solver, not just a homework finisher

also inference problems? they’re scary cause they make you feel like you’re supposed to be clever on demand but what they’re actually testing is whether you can step back, stay calm, and try something even if it’s wrong at first

last thing, get comfy with failure on practice stuff like legit say to yourself “i’m gonna try this even if i screw it up” cause every wrong attempt is a step closer to building that mental map you feel like you don’t have yet

you got the curiosity, the love for trig, the self-awarenessall you need now is time, reps, and some self-forgiveness when your brain freezes for a bit you’re not bad at math, you’re just still learning how to use it, and that’s a skill you can 100 percent build"
how do i actually get good at math,"""Practice, practice"" isn't even bad advice, it's just not advice. If you practice wrong, you will get worse.

Simply put, if you can't apply the topic, then you don't understand the topic (or at least the prerequisites). Understanding requires *knowledge*. I don't care if you can do homework problems or give an intuitive explanation. For example, can you tell me, right now with perfect wording:

* all the field axioms (distributive etc)
* the exponent rules
* what a function is
* why you do the same thing to both sides of an equation
* the three equation types you can solve?

If not yes to all, then you do not have the tools to do algebra. The list is not long, but if you don't know them and use them consciously, then you are not doing math. If you are doing something other than math, then you will not get better at math.

If by ""inference problem"" you just mean a problem you haven't seen before, then you just mean ""problem"". That is the normal type of problem. These will be easier to approach if you know the actual tools instead of recipes.

Of course if you're just talking about word problems, then that's just a separate skill and you should post about that instead."

"Let f:[0,1]→[0,T] be an onto differentiable function s.t. f(0)=0","For ≥T they probably intent for you to use the mean value theorem. The intermediate value theorem for derivatives (note that they don't have to be continuous) is a bit more advanced and you would need a point where you know that you are over and under, but then you already solved the question.

The only way that this type of inequality would be correct for all x is f(x)=Tx. Otherwise you will have sections where the derivative is greater and lower than T, e.g. look at f(x)=Tx² or f(x)=Tsin(πx)."

>however, I also think for all other x, f'(x)<T

No. Either f'(x) is identically T or it is sometimes less, sometimes greater, and sometimes equal to T. Consider g(x)= f(x)-Tx if that's clearer.


>So, which inequality is always correct?

>f'(x)≥T or f'(x)≤T ?

Neither."
"Let f:[0,1]→[0,T] be an onto differentiable function s.t. f(0)=0","The problem is just to show that f'(x) ≥ T for at least one value of x, not to show that f'(x) ≥ T for all values of x. Something *like* the IVT will work, but not that, since you don't know that f'(x) is continuous or anything. You should have a different theorem that guarantees a point where f'(x) is equal to a certain something with only the assumption that f(x) is differentiable.

To show that it's hopeless to prove that f'(x) ≤ T for all x or f'(x) ≥ T for all x, let's look for a counterexample. We want this function to be onto and differentiable, but it can be arbitrarily squiggly other than those requirements. A nice collection of squiggly functions come from trig functions, so let's try that. f(x) = sin(2𝜋x) maps [0, 1] onto [-1, 1], so we'll have to adjust that to make the range [0, T] instead. If we square the sine, we get a function from [0, 1] onto [0, 1], and then we can just multiply by T to get what we want. To make the function more squiggly, we just need to increase the frequency, so something like (sin(kx))^(2) might work.

Working out the details we get something like this. For a real number k ≥ 3/4, f(x) = T * (sin(k 𝜋x))^(2) is an onto map from [0, 1] to [0, T]. It hits 0 at x = 0 and T at x = 1/(2k) (which is in [0, 1] because k ≥ 3/4 ≥ 1/2) and by continuity, everything in between. But its derivative is as high as k𝜋T (at 1/(4k)) and as low as -k𝜋T (at 3/(4k) ≤ 1). Since k ≥ 3/4 > 1/𝜋, k𝜋T certainly exceeds T, while - k𝜋T is less than T. So f'(x) hits values on both sides of T."
"Let f:[0,1]→[0,T] be an onto differentiable function s.t. f(0)=0","The first inequality is always correct. I can start things off for you. Since f is onto, then we know there exists an x* in [0, 1] such that f(x*) = T. Then by the MVT, there exists some c in [0, x*] such that f’(c) = (f(x*) - f(0))/(x* - 0). You should now be able to argue that f’(c) >= T"

Where’s a good place to start learning proofs?,"Hi. I'm a mathematical physics grad student and I'd like to speak to you from this perspective.

Math proofs are much heavier than what you'd need for typical physics. Even if you're doing purely theoretical physics, you really don't need the in-depth understanding of math that you would get from studying mathematical proofs.

All that considered, if you still want a go, let's DO IT!

So a good option for a first textbook is Discrete math and it's applications by Kenneth H. Rosen. This will introduce you to very foundational logic; the application of logic into making a mathematical proof, and then some very basic proofs in number theory and combinatorics. The one problem with this book is because it's discrete math as opposed to continuous math, you are going to miss out on a good deep dive into calculus topics.

Now this is the part where this is super overkill, but if you want to go into calculus proofs, You'll want to do Advanced calculus by Patrick M. Fitzpatrick. In this book, you'll go over very foundational properties of real numbers. You'll learn about the supremums of intervals, rigorously proving convergence of sequences. Rigorously proving continuity of a function and relating epsilon-delta definitions with converging sequences, rigorous proofs about properties of derivatives and integrals, and then approximating with series.

If you want the ""honors' version, the big book is called ""principles of mathematical analysis"" by walter Rudin. It is more or less the same content, but instead of strictly real numbers, you will be taught in the context of arbitrary topological metric spaces. There's also much more side topics like differential geometry and the fundamental theorem of algebra (yes, it's funny, the fundamental theorem of algebra is an analysis proof instead of an algebraic one). Furthermore, this will introduce you to measure theory and a more generalized kind of integral called ""Lebesgue"". In this form of integral, you can calculate things like the integral of a function that's 1 if x is irrational and 0 if it's rational.

If you're a quantum kind of person, you'd also be very interested in Algebra (and particularly group theory). Algebra by Michael Artin is a great book for undergrad algebra, and it has a good section on group theory and group representation theory which are both important for quantum field theory.

  
edit: the rudin book was ""principles of"" not ""introdcution to"""
Where’s a good place to start learning proofs?,"So, I almost want to preface this by saying ""please disregard this message in its entirety"", but here we go.

Something that might help is reading proofs on simple things that you already know to be true, but given in a way that shows exactly how the theorems/lemmas are proven, rather than argued. If that sounds like a way to go, you might want to check out metamath.org. It has rigorous machine-checked proofs starting from base axioms, and building up from there.

There's good and bad with reading that if you're starting out. The good is, in theory, all proofs you write should be convertible into a form similar to the proofs on those pages, such that every step is spelled out and follows from previous steps. The bad is that this form can be over-complex depending on what any teacher/professor wants. If you can understand them, it may give some intuition on what you need to show in a proof, but you usually won't write proofs in that style directly.

Derivatives,"The derivative df/dx would be the rate of change of f with respect to x. In other words, how f changes when we vary x."
Derivatives,"The derivative at a point is the slope of the tangent line, ie the slope of the function at that point, instantaneous rate of change. 

The derivative f' is the function that returns the derivative at a point. That is, f'(x) is the slope of the tangent line of f at x.

You can write the equation of the tangent line at a,

y - f(a) = f'(a)(x - a)

That's y - k = m(x - h), point slope form of a line.

This line is the best linear approximation of the function near a."
Derivatives,"Suppose f is a function.  We say f is differentiable at c, if the graph y=f(x) has a well-defined tangent line at (c, f(c)) where that line has a well-defined slope.    The derivative of f is a function f’ that is defined where f differentiable and f’(x)= the slope of the line tangent at (x,f(x)).    Furthermore, 

f’(x)=the limit (f(x+h)-f(x))/h, as h->0."

Derivatives,"You have a function, f(x), which is a squiggly line on a graph.

At each point in the graph, there's a gradient. Like x\^2, at x=4 the gradient is 8, at x = 0 the gradient is 0.

The derivative f'(x) is the function that gives you the gradient of f(x) in terms of x. The function f'(x) = 2x tells you just double the x value and that's the gradient of the quadratic f(x) = x\^2

So when you are calculating derivatives, you are taking a function and turning it into another function that gives you the gradient of the original function at each point."
Derivatives,"look at the curve of some function f

The second derivative would be the acceleration at that point"

A derivative is the answer to the question “what rate is this function changing not at any single point, but at every point?” Ie, if f(x) is a continuously differentiable function, then f’(x) is the answer to that question. So f’(0) is the rate at which f(x) is changing at x=0, f’(1) is the rate at which f(x) is changing at x=1,…"

Derivatives,The derivative is the slope of the tangent line of a function at x. It tells you how the quickly the function is increasing/decreasing at a point. You can get some geometric intuition by playing around with this Desmos page if you're familiar with Desmos https://www.desmos.com/calculator/trz4bgxxdb.
Derivatives,"The derivative is the slope at a point. Draw a line between two points on a graph, and bring those points close and closer to each other. The slope that's approached as you bring these points closer and closer together is the derivative at the point you're approaching."

Derivatives,"Applying the derivative (wrt x) operator d/dx on some function f(x) simply means you are finding the instantaneous rate of change of a function at a certain point. 

Ex. df(x)/dx is a function that maps out all the instantaneous rates of change of the function f(x). Now if we set x=x_0 , then we have df(x_0 )/dx is the slope of f(x) when x=x_0 ."
Derivatives,"Derivative = the rate of change.

Imagine f(x), this is a function, and f'(x) is the derivative, which describe the rate of change of f, with respect to x. The derivative tell you how much f(x) vary when you vary x. With this information, it's possible to ""optimize"" f(x) by walking the function in the opposite direction of f'(x), repeat untill f'(x) is null. That would mean you have found a local minima/maxima in f(x).

This is called gradient descent/ascent and one the most usefull application of derivative. In general, when we talk about minimizing or maximizing a function (optimization), derivative are used somewhere in the process to tweak the parameters of a function.

Derivative also has a meaning in geometry, often represented as a tangeant line that match f(x) slope, and the derivative can also tell you a lot about local function behavior like the curvature for example.

Rate of change are also in general, usefull quantity that can be used to describe any change in a complex system. There's also the second derivative, the third derivative, ... which describe the rate of change of a rate of change :) .

Not all function are differentiable. In general your subject of interest will be a continuous function which are differentiable everywhere.

The inverse of derivative is integral (anti-derivative).

Derivative is a fundamental building block in variational calculus (the calculus of variation / how change of input affect the output of function and vice-versa)."

"why are the main 3 trig values we learn sin, cos, and tan, if the real main ones are sin,sec, and tan, and the co- versions are the complementary?",sin cos tan are easy to define on a right triangle and also come up in polar coordinates
"why are the main 3 trig values we learn sin, cos, and tan, if the real main ones are sin,sec, and tan, and the co- versions are the complementary?","The secant curve is a rather strange function, and normally the first time you experience an asymptote is usually tan(). And….well, that’s unavoidable. 

While in some cases sec is more useful, in a setting of learning about new ideas of continuous curves and periodic intervals, the introduction of the secant will slip people up. 

Generally you can get by with sin, cos, tan, for quite a while.

We have 3 sides, 3 angles and 3 primary trigonometric relationships, we choose to relate over the Hypotenuse (tan withstanding), because we define the hypotenuse in a unit circle to be equal to 1, (and that’s all we start knowing, imagine a circle whose radius is 1) so in my mind that is the general gist of all of trigonometry, is that those relationships hold true for all similar triangles/angles. And that can get really useful really quickly, because what do I mean by 1? inch? cm? mile? lightyear? 

While we should think about their inverses, I think you should have a firm grasp of the above concept before that happens"
"why are the main 3 trig values we learn sin, cos, and tan, if the real main ones are sin,sec, and tan, and the co- versions are the complementary?","The prefix ""co-"" actually refers to the fact that if A and B are *complimentary* angles, then sin(A) = cos(B), tan(A) = cot(B), and sec(A) = csc(B).

As for why sine, cosine, and tangent are the ""main ones,"" we first cared about sine and cosine because sine can tell you the vertical height of something and cosine can tell you the horizontal length of something. This is *the* foundational idea that leads to trig. We noticed that angles always preserve some sort of *horizontalness* and *verticalness* that we can describe through sine and cosine. Then what's cool about tangent is that it gives you the slope of an angle, because ""slope = rise/run"" and tan(x) = sin(x)/cos(x).

We then don't really get into teaching secant, cosecant, and cotangent until later because you can just describe each of those as the reciprocal of one of these 3 that we already know. They're not *super* useful except in a few situations, like measuring the rope needed for a ship's mast."
"why are the main 3 trig values we learn sin, cos, and tan, if the real main ones are sin,sec, and tan, and the co- versions are the complementary?","The names are mostly accidents of history. sin and cos turn out to have the nicest properties (e.g easily defined over the whole complex plane as a series with infinite convergence radius, with no poles or other misbehavior), so it makes sense to define all the others using those two as primitives."
"why are the main 3 trig values we learn sin, cos, and tan, if the real main ones are sin,sec, and tan, and the co- versions are the complementary?","Historically, sin cos and tan came first. They are not any more or less significant than sec, csc, or cotan.

I would argue that cos is much more common in use than sec and csc.

In simple harmonic motions, often times, physicists abbreivate the solution as Acos(ax+b) as oppose to asin(x) + bcos(x).

in calculus when you learn taylor series for the first time, the way you learn to approximate pi is with the taylor serries for invers tan.

In fourier analysis, you always either use cos(x) + isin(x) or e\^(-ix)."

"why are the main 3 trig values we learn sin, cos, and tan, if the real main ones are sin,sec, and tan, and the co- versions are the complementary?","the main reason is the pythagorean theorem and learning to convert cartesian to polar coordinates. It’s more logical to use sinx and cosx and then tanx as the quotient identity. Second, secx and cscx don’t need to be taught until derivatives in calculus, but even there, the cycle of sinx to cosx with derivatives makes their initial introduction more appropriate."
"why are the main 3 trig values we learn sin, cos, and tan, if the real main ones are sin,sec, and tan, and the co- versions are the complementary?",Really you only need one. Any others are just for convince. In the time before calculators dividing was time consuming so it was very helpful to have a name for trivial variations and tabulate them.
"why are the main 3 trig values we learn sin, cos, and tan, if the real main ones are sin,sec, and tan, and the co- versions are the complementary?","The ""co"" doesn't mean they are ""secondary"" trig functions with the others being the ""main"" ones.

The complement of an angle x is 90° - x.

**Co**sine is the sine of the **co**mplementary angle.

**Co**secant is the secant of the **co**mplementary angle.

**Co**tangent is the tangent of the **co**mplementary angle.

That why the prefix ""co"" is there."
"why are the main 3 trig values we learn sin, cos, and tan, if the real main ones are sin,sec, and tan, and the co- versions are the complementary?",I would disagree. Sin and cos are the two main ones. Just because of their use in polar coordinates and imaginary numbers
"why are the main 3 trig values we learn sin, cos, and tan, if the real main ones are sin,sec, and tan, and the co- versions are the complementary?","there's not really ""main"" and ""co-"" versions in the way you're thinking. really sin and cos are the main ones that the rest can be expressed in terms of, and the co- prefix on cos just represents that it's doing a thing similar to sin but for the other angle, same for csc and sec."
"why are the main 3 trig values we learn sin, cos, and tan, if the real main ones are sin,sec, and tan, and the co- versions are the complementary?","Sine and cosine are nice because they are the only ones bounded to a small range of values -1 to +1, and are defined for all real numbers (unlike the other four)

Tangent or cotangent as the third best choice for right triangles so we only need one trig function (instead of using sine/cosine at least twice for some problems), and using the non-co-version seems like the more natural choice"
"why are the main 3 trig values we learn sin, cos, and tan, if the real main ones are sin,sec, and tan, and the co- versions are the complementary?","Draw three separate sets of coordinate axes and put a right triangle in each with an angle t in the first quadrant. Label the sides of the first triangle so that sin(t)=x/a. Label the second so that tan(t)=x/a, and the third so that sec(t)=x/a. Solve for the missing third sides. You end up permuting x and a in such a way that the third side has algebraically different quadratic expression for each triangle, and together they are the possible cases for completing the square of a general quadratic.

If you repeat this with the co-functions, you get quadratic expressions that match with their original trig functions.

This motivates trig substitution in calculus, where sin/sec/tan emerge as the ""main"" group of functions. High school trig puts sin and cos centerstage because of how they represent Cartesian coordinates. In differential equations sin and cos again feature prominently because of their relationship to exp(x) and 2nd order ODEs"
"why are the main 3 trig values we learn sin, cos, and tan, if the real main ones are sin,sec, and tan, and the co- versions are the complementary?","It is arbitrary which function we call the ""complementary"" function.

Cosine is only **co**sine because we define sine as opposite over hypotenuse and so the sine of the complementary angle becomes adjacent over hypotenuse *relative to the original angle*.

But if we started by defining a function, let's call it ""soc"", defined as adjacent over hypotenuse (in other words, soc = cos) then the soc of the complementary angle, cosoc, would be our sine.

To put it another way: the cosine function is the sine function shifted by 90°, and the sine function is the cosine function shifted by 90°. Neither is more fundamental than the other.

Why did opposite over hypotenuse get chosen as the ""first"" function? That takes us back to the ancient Greeks and their [early trig tables in terms of the chord function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy%27s_table_of_chords), and [the Indian mathematicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jy%C4%81,_koti-jy%C4%81_and_utkrama-jy%C4%81) which is where we get the name ""sine"" from.

This brings up the related question: how many trigonometric functions are there?

The answer [could be 1, 3, 6 or at least 12](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2009/09/25/how-many-trig-functions/)."
"why are the main 3 trig values we learn sin, cos, and tan, if the real main ones are sin,sec, and tan, and the co- versions are the complementary?",Cause you can see them by drawing 2 lines and a circle. (They are really concrete)
"why are the main 3 trig values we learn sin, cos, and tan, if the real main ones are sin,sec, and tan, and the co- versions are the complementary?",Wait until you throw in the hyberpbolic versions which get “h” at the end
"why are the main 3 trig values we learn sin, cos, and tan, if the real main ones are sin,sec, and tan, and the co- versions are the complementary?","Because sine, cosine, and tangent are the three main functions. Really, tangent is derived from sine/cosine. 

To see it, start with the origin and draw a line arbitrarily up and to the right for some distance. Now, set the length of that line segment equal to 1.

Now, draw two more lines from the upper right end of the line segment, one vertically down to the X axis, and one horizontally over to the Y axis. We now have a rectangle divided into two right triangles, with the hypotenuse having a length of 1.

The sine value is the ratio of the vertical line to the hypotenuse, or in this case, simply the length of the vertical line. 

The cosine value is the ratio of the horizontal line to the hypotenuse, or in this case, simply the length of the horizontal line. 

The tangent value is the length of the vertical line divided by the length of the horizontal line. 

All of trigonometry is based on those ratios. As the angle of the hypotenuse changes (swinging around the origin), the lengths of the vertical and horizontal lines also change, and the relationship between those forms the basis of trigonometric functions.

When the hypotenuse is not a length of 1, the ratios still hold; it is scalable."
"why are the main 3 trig values we learn sin, cos, and tan, if the real main ones are sin,sec, and tan, and the co- versions are the complementary?","First, recognize that sec x is the same as 1/(cos x) so long as you take the limit so 1/infinity goes to zero.

Now, you could replace every instance of cos x in all of the equations we use with lim y->x 1/(sec y), and, presto, we could teach it as a main function. 


But here's the thing... In math and physics, sec doesn't appear the numerator in very many places, but lim y->x 1/(sec y), or cos x, shows up all the time.

That's because sin and cos happen to be the two functions you need to break a vector into component form.  So it shows up in Euler's identity, shows up in the dot and cross products, shows up when taking a projection, fourier series, etc., and while we could write 1/sec everywhere... Why would we?

So really, it's just because those are the three most common functions you ever see."

"why are the main 3 trig values we learn sin, cos, and tan, if the real main ones are sin,sec, and tan, and the co- versions are the complementary?","Let's play a game. I will give you some information about a real number x with 0<=x<2pi and you tell me what that number is, ok?

Suppose I tell you that sin(x)=sqrt(2)/2. What is x?  
Well, this isn't enough information, there are two possible x's that satisfy this, namely x=pi/4 and x = 3pi/4.  
Okay, maybe you can't guess the number itself, but can you guess the value of its tan? Also no, we still have two possibilities.  
Suppose I then tell you that cossec(x)=sqrt(2), does that help? Not at all. This gives no extra info.  
What if I told you that cos(x)= - sqrt(2)/2? Now you got it! x has to be 3pi/4.

Any time you tell me sin(x) and cos(x), they completely specify the value of x, as well as of every other trig function of x. This is one of the senses in which sine and cossine are generally considered more fundamental. There are other reasons, of course, and other commenters have pointed some of them out.

""Wait a minute!"", you say, ""if you told me sin(x)=3pi/4 and that tan(x) = -1 I could have guessed the number! So why not consider sin(x) and tan(x) and leave cossine out?"". You could also say this, for example for sine and cossecant. But it doesn't always work. If I tell you that sin(x)=0 and tan(x) = 0, you still can't find the value of x. Sine and cossine do it for every x in that interval.

Now you ask ""So why do we also treat tan as fundamental""? I disagree we do, but yes, we do teach it very early alongside sine and cossine. Truth is we don't need to, we don't even need to have a name for it to be fair, since everything follows from sine and cossine. The reason we do it is because it's convenient. In many places an expression of the kind sin(x)/cos(x) appears so we gave it a name. It particularly appears a lot when looking at right triangles, which is where one usually has their first contact with trig, so we teach about it."
How do I do well in Math?,"So there is a concept called deliberate practice. 
https://fs.blog/deliberate-practice-guide/

Say you study for a test, and you get 80%

If you follow deliberate practice that means you go out of the way after the test to answer the questions you got wrong, by studying the concept a you didn’t grasp or understand. That score indicates what you don’t know. 

The act of deliberate practice also applies before the test. It suggests if you did 10 questions representative of the test you would also get 80%. 

Your job then is to identify which parts you get wrong before you take a test. If you don’t know which parts are hard then maybe it means you get something wrong, look at the book, and say, “Oh, I get it” and then stopping. If you want 100% you need to take a similar problem and solve it correctly in one try. After that you take another practice test, and repeat the process of fixing the parts you get wrong. 

Maybe you’re struggling with the actual process rather than the material. First look at the problem and identify all the things you know. Given the subject material identify all the relationships between all the variables. 

From this list of relationships you now have a list of things you don’t know and can solve for. 

If one of these relationships and unknown variables happens to be the solution to the problem you’re done. 

If it isn’t then you need to identify which relationships, known values, and unknowns values are needed to solve the problem. Given your first list of unknowns you should be able to apply one of these relationships to generate a second list of values. Compare this second list of unknown values, and determine if that solves the problem. If so then you now know how to get the final answer. 

Generally problems aren’t made so complex you need to do this more than once. For example:
You know velocity and time and don’t know distance. You have a relationship that connects velocity * time to give you distance. Hence applying that relationship gives you the answer. 

However if you aren’t given the time, but instead a location such as New York at 11:00am, and a location such as Montreal at 4:00pm. You know velocity, now you need to calculate the time elapsed. Given time elapsed and velocity you can now calculate the distance. "
How do I do well in Math?,"You’re doing IBDP? 

Aahl?"
How do I do well in Math?,"I don't know exactly what topics are covered in which years in the Canadian curriculum. So, did you do okay at the beginning of algebra? It feels like one possible explanation is that you were comfortable as long as the focus was *calculation*, and were fine doing problems where the focus was getting numerical values for purely numerical expressions. The crucial question is, how did you do the first time algebra was introduced?

So if I had to guess, I would say that sometime near the beginning of algebra, you missed an important concept, and without that concept nothing afterward made any sense. Some examples of things you might have missed or misunderstood are: What is an equation? What is a variable? What are these things used for? But I could easily have missed the mark here, and the missing piece is something else.

If that diagnosis is correct, then the right thing to do would be go to Khan Academy (free, registration recommended) and start with their 7th grade class. I'd recommend that starting level because you need to learn how to use Khan's interface on material you know already. The sequence from there would be, 7th grade, 8th grade, Algebra 1, Geometry (optional), Algebra 2, Trigonometry, Precalculus. (I *think* trig and precalculus are probably the equivalent of ""advanced functions"" but I'm not sure.) But I am guessing that somewhere in Algebra 1 or Algebra 2, Khan will tell you something (the missing concepts) that make you go ""Oh! Is *that* what they meant?"" and things will get a lot clearer."

Why would I do calculations with radicals in a real world scenario?,">I'm trying to understand calculations with radicals. I'm not asking about the method for adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing radicals with each other but what these calculations solve in the world.

Radicals are ""just"" a number. And I honestly use them at least a few times a week. A lot of things in the world are squared, so being able to handle radicals are really useful. 

Interest rate are squared, so you can work out how much or how long different kinds of loans will affect stuff. Same thing with investments. Or inflation. 

Kinetic energy is squared, so calculating braking distance, energy consumptions, or terminal velocity is done with it. 

Statistics are every where and standard deviation is the square root of the variance - so understanding radical is helping understanding statistics. 

You can use it to calculate angles from triangles, really good if you ever want to do any home renovating.

You can use it calculate how much space you need for stuff. How many boxes can I fit in here? Or I have 37 boxes of pieces of wood that are going to be needed one day, so how big of a shed do I need to store them all?

Since most of all radicals are irrational they don't really repeat. Understanding that means that you can estimate things that can repeat and what can't repeat. Like how flowers use irrational numbers so their leaves overlap as little as possible. Which is good if you don't want overlap. If you do want it, just stay clear of them.

Music theory where octaves are an interval between two notes, where the frequency between them is twice or half. This is how the frequency then adds both destructive and constructive, making music sound good or bad. Just take a look at Pythagorean interval or chromatic semitones... And that is also why a guitarr is tuned the way it is and why a piano and a violin don't sound good together. 

Also just understanding stuff like how energy disperse, in 2 dimension it is squared, hence energy drops by the square of the distance. Or in 3 dimensions, where it is cubed, as with sound, explosion or luminance of light sources or the sun..."
Why would I do calculations with radicals in a real world scenario?,"A number like the square root of seven is a real number, it's between two and three on the number line, and it represents a specific quantity and just like any other real number does. If you multiply the square root of seven by two, you have a quantity that is twice as big; if you divide the square root of seven by the cube root of three, you get a smaller quantity which has the same ratio to the square root of seven as the number one has to the cube root of three.

Yes exponents get used in geometry, but ""square roots"" don't require referencing a specific square shape. Exponents represent repeated multiplication, and the radical is one of the inverse operations for exponents (the other inverse operation is the logarithm).

Here's an idea that often gets skipped over, if your investment account went down 10% one day and up 6% the next day, what was the average change per day? You wouldn't want to just add those numbers and divide by two, because in this scenario we aren't adding up the percentages. Instead, what we're doing is multiplying by 0.90 and then multiplying by 1.06, so the average should be some number that could be multiplied by itself (squared) and give the same result as multiplying 0.9 by 1.06. That product is 0.954, and the number we want is the square root of 0.954 (which is 0.977, meaning on average the investment account went down by 2.33% per day). I may be explaining this badly, but it's called the ""geometric mean,"" you multiply together your n number of multipliers and then take the n-th root of the product."

Stuck On This Type of Angle Problem (High School),"First rule: pay attention to marks indicating equal lengths or parallel lines.

Second rule: add up internal angles around polygons.

Third rule: remember the rules for lines crossing parallels and lines crossing lines.

The first problem for example: the upper triangle is isoceles, so its base angles are equal, and the base angles plus the apex angle x sum to 180°, so the base angles are (180-x)/2=90-½x.

The bottom triangle's remaining angle is 180-85-35=60.

* BOMDAS is one such rule.

* The programming language APL uses a ""right to left"" rule.

So why pick BOMDAS instead of your rule or some other rule? History, and because the community of mathematicians ""decided"" that it's nicer that way. Here's a section from wikipedia, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order\_of\_operations:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations:)

>The order of operations emerged progressively over centuries. The rule that multiplication has precedence over addition was incorporated into the development of [algebraic notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_notation) in the 1600s, since the distributive property implies this as a natural hierarchy. As recently as the 1920s, the historian of mathematics [Florian Cajori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florian_Cajori) identifies disagreement about whether multiplication should have precedence over division, or whether they should be treated equally. The term ""order of operations"" and the ""PEMDAS/BEDMAS"" mnemonics were formalized only in the late 19th or early 20th century, as demand for standardized textbooks grew. Ambiguity about issues such as whether implicit multiplication takes precedence over explicit multiplication and division in such expressions as *a*/2*b*, which could be interpreted as *a*/(2*b*) or (*a*/2) × *b*, imply that the conventions are not yet completely stable."
Why is bomdas a thing?,"It's a thing for exactly the reason you pointed out. Depending on which operations you do first you can get different answers. We don't want math expressions to be ambiguous, so we have rules about how they're meant to be read (and written). In your example, you're assuming the default is left to right, but why not right to left? Maybe we could tackle numbers biggest to smallest (a real problem for your example).  
The other thing is, the system we have with [infix notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation) and bomdas makes algebraic manipulations pretty easy. In your example there's not much going on, but sometimes math gets harder than counting apples and you have to move the numbers all over the place. At that point, making sure everything stays good when read from left to right is gonna be a big headache."
Why is bomdas a thing?,Standardization. That's all.
Why is bomdas a thing?,It's so you can write polynomials without using parentheses. 5x^2 + 10x - 1 is unambiguous if you use proper order of operations. So is 1/2x^2 + 2. If you wanted it to be 1/( 2x^2 ) you would use parentheses or write it as 1/2x^-2
Why is bomdas a thing?,"For the same reason that the furry creature who sleeps on the floor in my house is called ""the dog"". It's language: words and symbols that we use to communicate meaning. In order to communicate, we need to have a shared understanding of what these words and symbols mean.

In general, there's a convention of multiplication and division coming being evaluated ahead of addition and subtraction, and of exponentiation coming first. As someone else comments, there's good algebraic reasons for this, because of the relationships between these operations (multiplication being repeated addition, exponentiation repeated multiplication).

More ambiguous is the ""same level operations"" -- subtraction vs addition, multiplication vs division. The different versions of the mnemonic aren't even consistent on this -- I was taught BEDMAS but others are taught PEMDAS -- multiplication and division in opposite orders. Probably the best approach is to treat division/multiplication and addition/subtraction left-to-right, but there's no agreement on that. 

But, to emphasize, that's not a mathematical disagreement. It's just different languages of elementary maths, or maybe dialects. Like how in American English ""I could care less"" means the same as ""I couldn't care less"" in British English, even though the two are, semantically, the exact opposite of each other.

Ultimately, the real answer is, don't communicate ambiguously; write using language that everyone understands. Real maths doesn't actually use the ➗ or ✖️ symbol much at all; expressions are written in a way that makes order of operations unclear. Programming languages do have to deal with multiplication and division symbols directly, and hence order of operations needs to be defined, but programmers aim to write legible code, which can be debugged and improved, they're generally going to write any arithmetic of this type in a way that is unambiguous."

Why is bomdas a thing?,I have never heard of Bomdas.
Why is bomdas a thing?,">if you take 5 apples, add 5 apples to the original 5 apples, thats 10 apples, multiply that 10 apples by 5 thats 50

That's true, and so the question is, how can we write that down with symbols?

With the standard order of operations, ""5+5\*5"" means something else. It would mean:

""Take 5 apples, then add them to a group of 5-by-5 apples."" And thats 30.

\---

It is useful to group up the most 'powerful' operations first, so that we can talk about them in groups, without needing brackets.

Like if ""x"" is some important value (income, blood flow, drug half-life whatever), then we'd like:

* ""x+2"" to mean ""2 more than x""
* and ""2x"" to mean ""twice x"" or ""double the amount that x is""
* and we'd like ""x\^2"" to mean ""the square of x"".

Well, BOMDAS means it usually *does* mean that. However, if we always did things left-to-right, then often those symbols would change meaning depending on what was written before them!

For me to keep the same meaning, I'd need to carefully write things in a specific order.

And what if I want to add double-x and double-y  and double-z together?

I'd like to simply write: 2x+2y+2z

But if we *always read left-to-right*, then there is **no** way to use multiplcayion to write it down! I'd have to write ""x+x+y+y+z+z"", because any use of multiplcation wouldn't work. But the whole point of multipclation was to let us write down repeated addition quickly.  

If you allow brackets to change the order, then I'd be forced to write it like: ""((2x)+2y)+2z"", which is really inconvenient when I want to just do some simple addition, but every time I want to add just 1 more thing, I have to put in another set of brackets."
Why is bomdas a thing?,"It's just syntax rules.

""Take 5 apples, add 5 apples to it, then multiply that by 5"" *is written as* (5+5)x5, or 5x(5+5).

The original equation, 5+5x5 is agreed by convention to mean the same as 5+(5x5), or (5x5)+5. Which would translate to ""take 5 apples, multiply that by 5, then add 5 more""

As you can see, adding proper brackets/parentheses complete disambiguates the issue, and removes the problem of interpretation by explicitly showing how we want to logically group things, but without those groupings, we just have to agree on a standard for how we want to interpret things. 

The agreed standard is that you resolve multiplication before addition, instead of just left to right. In such a simple example it seems less intuitive, but in more complicated examples there is a justified reasoning for the order we agree on."

Yes, according to the most common convention regarding the notational precedence of arithmetic operations, that expression evaluates to 16. The convention is that multiplication and division take precedence over multiplication and subtraction; the operations of the same precedence level are grouped left-to-right.


The alternative is to put multiplication denoted by juxtaposition on its own precedence level, higher than any of the operations denoted by an explicitly written operator. In this case, the expression in question evaluates to 1.


Note than neither of the above conventions is ""more correct"" than the other. The former is simply more common than the latter.

no way ppl think 8/2(2+2) is 16,"Multiplication by juxtaposition is always difficult.

If I have two variables a and b, I can multiply them together and write it as ab. This is multiplication by juxtaposition.

If I want to take the reciprocal of ab then I should write it as 1/(ab), the brackets making it clear that a is multiplied by b before the reciprocal is taken.

If I write 1/ab instead then I have created an ambiguity:

1. Applying rules strictly. Multiplication by juxtaposition is typically given the same priority as any other multiplication so 1/ab = 1÷a×b = b/a. 
2. Looking at the intent of the author. If someone writes 1/ab it is likely that they intend ab to considered as a single term and should really have written 1/(ab)."

Just failed my Calculus 1 course. How can I pass the retake?,"See if there are any other resources you can go to and use. Most universities have tutoring centers, and some even specifically for math.

Separately, if specifically related rates was the problem, if you understand implicit differentiation related rates are just those kinds of problems but in word problem form. If you know the geometric relationships relevant to the picture of the situation you’ll be fine. For example, I gave my class a related rate about a melting snowball. Snowballs are typically modeled as sphere, and the question asked about the change of volume. The volume of the sphere is 4/3pi*r^3, and so this is the relationship to differentiate."

Just failed my Calculus 1 course. How can I pass the retake?,"Related rates is mechanically easy if you think of the derivative as a fraction. You won't always be able to do this if you proceed on in math though.

e.g.

dy/dx = dy/dw \* dw/dx

Just failed my Calculus 1 course. How can I pass the retake?,"first off don’t be embarrassed failing calc 1 don’t mean you’re dumb it just means you’re still figuring out how to learn this stuff and for a lotta people, related rates is exactly where the wheels start to shake cause it’s the first time you gotta turn a word problem into an equation before you even do any math

the biggest key to passing the retake isn’t grinding more problems it’s learning how to break down the language of the problem like what’s changing, what’s staying constant, what are you actually solving for
with related rates, draw the diagram, write down all the variables that are changing, label what’s given and what you’re trying to find, then write the equation that ties them together before you touch the derivative

also, don’t study by rereading notes or just watching videos start doing what’s called active recall
look at a solved problem, close it, and try to explain how you’d solve it in your own words
then check yourself
and when you miss something, go back and fix just that part
that’s how your brain starts building patterns, not just memorizing shapes

and don’t let the “calc is straightforward” crowd get in your head some folks had stronger algebra or geometry foundations going in and that makes a huge difference
you’re not late you’re just learning in your own lane
and now that you’ve seen the whole course once you’ll have way more context second time around
you got this fr just don’t go at it the same way and expect a different result
study different think different and ask for help early even if it feels awkward"

Online Precalc Courses for Free,"When I was in a similar situation and needed to refresh my precalc (though with many more years between me and my last math class), I used myOpenMath. You can enroll in the self-study precalc courses. There's a free textbook that accompanies the courses.

https://www.myopenmath.com/

After you've got through the precalc material, you might want to try working ahead on calculus. That will make your fall semester a bit lighter by shifting some of the work to the summer - when you get to your actual calc class, you'll be a bit ahead, and the first unit or two will be review. I used the OpenStax calculus books for this. They may or may not be the best books. I think they're fine, but there are probably better books out there. But, they're free, and fit a very standard calculus curriculum. So they should suffice to prepare you for pretty much any calc I course at pretty much any college or university. You could also email the professor you'll be taking calculus with and ask for a syllabus, so that you can use the same book, so that you can study topics in the same order, and so that you'll know which sections are safe to skip."

Im probably wrong but..,"If you are asking if getting one of 2 balls in a box of 10 distinct balls has a probability of 1/5, then that would correct.

If you are asking about chance of picking out one of the 10 distinct balls within 2 tries \*\*with\*\* replacement (e.g. you put the ball back into the box if it's isn't correct before you pick for the 2nd time), then that would be incorrect because the probability of not picking the ball you wanted within 2 tries is (9/10)\^2 = 81/100, so the overall chance of success is 1 - 81/100 = 19/100.

I don’t understand why ln(e^-800)=-infinity,"The real value of ln(e^-800) is -800. But the computer doesn't know that. It computes e^-800, which is so small it ends up being 0 for the computer, then -infinity through the log."
I don’t understand why ln(e^-800)=-infinity,"ln(e\^-800) = -800, not -infinity.



The calculator is giving a result of -infinity because when do math on computers we typically convert them to [floating point numbers ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic)then do math on them. Since e cannot be represented in binary with a finite amount of memory it leads to errors. Since e\^-800 is an extremely smaller number it probably ends up being represented as 0 then ln(0) is probably defined to be -infinity by the calculator."
I don’t understand why ln(e^-800)=-infinity,"Because of how computers deal with numbers, e^(-800) is (for a computer) the same as zero, even if (for a mathematician) it isn't. So for a computer, ln(e^(-800)) is ln(0), which is -infinity, rather than -800 as it ought to be."

I don’t understand why ln(e^-800)=-infinity,"as all the others are saying: it's not, the correct answer is -800 as the natural log inverts the exponential.

Most computer systems are going to have a hard time with this, because the simple and extremely common way to do numerical computations is via floating point arithmetic - on modern hardware, usually that means IEEE 754's 64 bit double-precision floating point, though many computers also have an 80 bit floating point representation for doing some calculations - but that tends only to improve accuracy of some intermediate steps if it's used at all.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision\_floating-point\_format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format)

The rough idea there is to treat every number as basically a binary-version of scientific notation - a sign, an exponent, and a fractional part, so ±2\^e \* 1.d; in 64 bit floats, the sign is 1 bit, the exponent is 11 bits, and the fractional part (basically, the binary version of digits after the decimal point) is 52 bits; the exponent can be -1022 to +1023; a small part of the range is also reserved for infinity and NaN (not a number, e.g. what you get if you compute 0/0 or inf-inf).  
  
Breaking down what that means, doubles can precisely represent numbers whose absolute values are:  
\- integers from 0 to 2\^53  
\- fractions whose denominators are powers of 2, up to 2\^1022 in the denominator with the first 53 bits of the numerator (i.e. rounded to something that's within about 1.1\*10\^-14 %)  
\- numbers larger than 2\^53 but only to the nearest 1/2\^53 proportion (i.e. rounded to something that's within about 1.1\*10\^-14 %), and only if they are < 2\^1024

below 2\^-1022 some numbers down to \~2\^-1074 can be represented, but with each power of 2 smaller than 2\^-1022 meaning a loss of accuracy of an additional bit. (this is known as floating point underflow)

The problem with your original calculation is that e\^-800 is about 2\^-1,154.156, which gets rounded to the nearest 2\^-1022 so is computed to be 0, at which point you get ln(0) = -infinity

Making a truly accurate calculator with a computer that can handle stuff like this requires at least a larger data format that can track a larger part of the reals without loss of accuracy, but purely numerical computations can never always give the right answer; that said they are much much faster than other methods so tend to be preferred when perfect accuracy isn't needed.  Getting perfect answers really requires a computer algebra system, but some interesting designs have come up with partial answers that cover a lot of common-ish cases.

Topics you might be interested in, if you want to learn more:  
\- Numerical analysis is the field of study of the power & limits of floating point systems.  In practice learning this is useful for learning how to spot possible loss of accuracy in various formulas and rewrite them to avoid the problem (e.g. to compute sqrt(x+1)-sqrt(x), you'll get a more accurate answer by computing 1/(sqrt(x+1)+sqrt(x)) - which is equivalent, but the original formula has the weakness that the high digits will cancel and the inaccurate lower digits will be left, leading to a less accurate result) and also to better quantify error cases  
\- [https://chadnauseam.com/coding/random/calculator-app](https://chadnauseam.com/coding/random/calculator-app) is a very interesting piece explaining how the Android calculator is designed to avoid some of these pitfalls."
I don’t understand why ln(e^-800)=-infinity,Numerical instability
I don’t understand why ln(e^-800)=-infinity,"Well, ln(e^(-800)) isn't *infinite*, it's just very very negative. Basically, for any number a > 1, a^(-x) gets close to 0 for large values of x. Then log of any number close to 0 shoots down towards -infinite. So if e^(-x) is close to 0, then ln(e^(-x)) is goes towards -infinity.

Also since you're using e and ln, we can also just cancel them out and get -x (since logs are the opposite of exponents), which clearly will just go to -infinity as x gets really big."

The diagram is something like this"
I made up this question myself can someone verify/find the correct answer,"There is no single value of a and single value of b. There is an infinite set of points that satisfy these constraints. Instead of a single point S, you can find a line and call it S. Point R would also be on that line, which means it's quite easy to find the equation of the line.

Rewrite L as y = 1/3\*x + 4/3. Line S has the same slope as L (1/3) but a different y-intercept (not 4/3). So the equation of S will be y = 1/3\*x + b, and we have to find the value of b. Since S contains point R, we can substitute the coordinates of R into the x and y of this equation: 2 = 1/3\*1 + b, thus b = 5/3, and the equation of S is y = 1/3\*x + 5/3.

If you want to know the length of p, it's 1/3, the difference between the y-intercepts of L and S.

Also, while your diagram is very neatly drawn and pleasant to look at, it's mathematically very flawed. The slope of the line and the position of point R are not merely poor estimates, they're simply wrong on an intuitive level. I think you should work on your understanding of line slopes, what general direction a line should be pointing given its slope, and the general location of a point given its coordinates. If you improve these skills, it may help improve your intuition for questions like the one you asked.

EDIT: I didn't consider the possibility of the line being on the other side of L (thanks u/Consistent-Annual268). In that case you would need a second line, y = 1/3\*x + 1, derived from subtracting the length p (1/3) from the y-intercept of L rather than adding it."

the second equality holding because it is clear that X >= k+1 implies X >= k. Might as well try k = 1 since the conditions look like they'd be useful there. We get

P(X >= 2) = 𝛾P(X >= 1)

If you're okay with the slightly contrived approach (which admittedly the unit step thing also is) then you can modify the floor function to do the job.  Desmos knows floor(x) too if that's your main tool.  See the wiki page on the [sawtooth wave](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sawtooth_wave). 


That last page also has what I'd consider the ""least contrived"" approach, but it sacrifices simplicity, and that's the Fourier series approach. "

Questions about basis vectors,"In general case vectors aren't objects with tails or something like that.

Vectors are some objects, with defined some operations, defined  ""zero vector"", and some assosiated scalar field so that you can muptiply  them by scalars. Such a definition allows many objects to be  vectors, for example  set of polynomials   (i.e function w in form   w(x)=a ₙ x ⁿ+...+a ₁ x+a ₀ for some natural n) with real numbers as scalar field, is set of vectors.

Regarding basis,  basis is basically this, a ""base"" of your structure. Suppose  you have some vector space, call it V.  A set of vectors {v1,...,vn} is  basis if  1) you can generate any vector v   from V as a linear combination of these vectors, i.e   for some scalars a ₁,..., a ₙ   ,    v= a ₁ v ₁ +... + a ₙ v ₙ,  2)     these vectoss are linearly independent (so it's not the case that for example  v ₃ is linear combination of the rest of basis vectors).


For example,  set of three polynomials   {1,x, x²}  forms   a basis of a vector space cosnsiting  polynomials of degree (the ""max"" power in polynomial) 2."
Questions about basis vectors,"> If the answer is 'because basis vectors can change from point to point', why is this the case?

**Assumption:** You consider R^3 -- for the more abstract case, others got you covered.
***
Yes. Remember that we need to parametrize the space R^3 by 3 parameters. If they are ""p := [p1; p2; p3]^T "", then every point ""r in R^3 "" can be (uniquely) represented by

    r:  R^3 -> R^3,    r(p)  =  [x(p); y(p); z(p)]^T

Assuming the parametrization is differentiable: A natural choice of base at any point ""r(p)"" are the directions ""ek"" we get if we only change one parameter ""pk"" a little bit, and leave the others constant. To be precise:

    ek  :=  ∂r(p) / ∂pk,    1 <= k <= 3

Notice the basis vectors ""ek"" still depend on the parameters ""p"", so they may change orientation for each point in space. The three common parametrizations of R^3 are all defined like this: Cartesian, polar and spherical. These three share another trait -- they generally lead to orthogonal base vectors ""ek""!"
Questions about basis vectors,"Aside from the direction changing point to point (e.g. on the sphere as someone else mentioned), the length of the basis vector can change. A basis vector [1, 0] need not have a length of 1; the metric tensor determines the length explicitly.

This is separate from curvature of the space in question and only depends on the choice of coordinates. Standard polar coordinates in R^(2) have angular and radial basis vectors. Whatever point you choose in the plane, the radial vector points away from the origin and the angular vector points 90 degrees counterclockwise relative to the radial vector.

Generally you can define the basis vectors at a point as the velocity vector that comes from an increment to one of the coordinates/parameters (which is where the partial derivative definition of basis vectors comes in). Using this definition for the angular vector, the arc length that results from some d(theta) will depend on the r coordinate, so the velocity vector grows longer, or you can choose to scale the basis vector by (1/r) so that it is always a unit length."
Questions about basis vectors,"I believe you are referring to the idea of a frame from differential geometry. You take vector fields (sections of the tangent bundle) such that at each point the vectors designated by the fields form a basis of the tangent space at that point. 

Introduction to Smooth Manifolds by Lee constructs them... Although it's a bit heavy."
Questions about basis vectors,"In R^n , you can visualise tangent vectors at P as arrows that have their tail at P. There is a canonical way to identify tangent spaces, because we can translate.

When you talk about a general smooth manifold, there is no canonical way to identify the tangent spaces at different points (aside: you can for Lie groups though, see the cartan-maurer form). 

Each co-ordinate chart gives a way to identify the tangent spaces, but this depends on the chart. If you want to compare nearby tangent spaces, there is the notion of a connection, but this doesnt quite give a canonical way of identifying tangent spaces either: if you want to compare the tangents are two points, it generally depends on the path chosen for the parallel transport. The curvature can be interpreted as a measure of the local obstruction to identifying tangent spaces.  But even if the curvature is zero, you can still get a global obstruction. (aside: see holonomy/monodromy).

As to why a partial derivative can be thought of as a tangent vector, it is because they define a derivation. On a smooth manifold, there are many different ways to define what a tangent vector means, and they are all equivalent. For example, via coordinate chart, via equivalence classes of curves or as derivation of (germs of) smooth functions. You can look at any introduction text on differentiable manifold for full details. But intuitively, if you have a coordinate chart, keeping all by one of the coordinates constant gives a ""grid"", and the partial derivative can be visualised as pointing along the grid lines."
Questions about basis vectors,"What do you mean by 'vector' and 'basis vector'?

When I first learned about vectors in school, it was helpful to imagine all vectors to have their tail at the origin and tip at the corresponding point (since they don't change under translation)

If you want to imagine vectors as arrows, the arrow connecting the origin to (1,1) would represent the same vector as the arrow from (3,2) to (4,3)"
Why is the SAS test of congruence treated as an axiom specifically? Why not the others like SSS?,"The practical answer: All of congruences can be proved from SAS and it's easier to start there than with the other congruences. 

Historically in Euclid's Elements his argument for SAS boiled down to ""eh. If you pretend to line up the congruent side lengths and line up the congruent angle, then everything lines up so they're congruent."" People wanted to avoid this kind of argument, but couldn't without adding unnecessary structure to your geometry. So they just decided to make it an axiom."
Why is the SAS test of congruence treated as an axiom specifically? Why not the others like SSS?,"It has more to do with the definition you were given of congruence. So if your book says:


> Two triangles are **congruent** if they have two sides of equal length and the angle between the two sides is equal.


Then SAS becomes what ""congruent"" means.


Can you find the definition of congruence in your book?


(As an aside, when a sentence is a definition you can treat ""if"" as a bidirectional ""if and only if"")


It's also possible that they don't want you to have to prove something that may be too difficult at your level, like if congruence is defined as being able to rotate/slide shapes so they perfectly overlap, but you haven't learned how to calculate the coordinates of a rotated shape, for example. So they just choose one as an axiom so you can skip those steps."
Why is the SAS test of congruence treated as an axiom specifically? Why not the others like SSS?,"reason might be because two side lengths and an angle always define a valid, unique (down to reflection) triangle - no matter what numbers you pick for side lengths and angles, you definitely get some specific triangle. Sides 1, 100 and angle 25°: valid triangle, guaranteed, even though I picked those numbers at random. 

Whereas three side lengths only define a triangle if they meet the triangle inequality - each pair of sides is greater or equal than the other side. There is no triangle with side lengths 1, 2 and 100. 

Likewise angle side angle has the constraint that the two angles must sum to less than 180° to make a valid, unique triangle. 

So two sides and an angle form a better basis for describing ‘the space of all possible triangles’. "
Why is the SAS test of congruence treated as an axiom specifically? Why not the others like SSS?,"This should help you. From Google

Triangle congruence statements can be either theorems or postulates. Specifically, Side-Side-Side (SSS), Side-Angle-Side (SAS), and Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) are postulates, while Angle-Angle-Side (AAS) and Hypotenuse-Leg (HL) are theorems. 

Explanation:

Postulates:

These are statements that are accepted as true without proof. They are fundamental assumptions upon which other geometric truths are built.

Theorems:

These are statements that can be proven using accepted postulates and previously proven theorems. 

In the context of triangle congruence:

SSS, SAS, ASA:

These postulates provide shortcuts for determining if two triangles are congruent based on specific combinations of sides and angles.

AAS, HL:

These theorems are derived from the postulates and can be proven using them, providing additional ways to demonstrate triangle congruence. "
Why is the SAS test of congruence treated as an axiom specifically? Why not the others like SSS?,"If you are curious about this topic, you will probably find a read of the wikipedia article [Foundations of geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_geometry) interesting.   Particularly read [Hilbert's Axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_geometry#Hilbert's_axioms) & note the difference between those & the ones you are working with (it's Ok if you don't understand *all* the details, I don't either without spending a bunch of time with them. But you'll easily catch the gist of the major differences between that approach & the one you see in your book).

Also read through the section on [School Geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_geometry#School_geometry), where they discuss issues with developing axiomatic systems that are both rigorous (at least reasonably so...) and also work from a practical pedagogical standpoint.

A few interesting statements caught my eye:

* in order to gear the treatment to a high school audience, some mathematical and logical arguments were either ignored or slurred over.
* The increased number of axioms has the pedagogical advantage of making early proofs in the development easier to follow . . . .
* whereas Birkhoff tried to minimize the number of axioms used, and most authors were concerned with the independence of the axioms in their treatments, the SMSG axiom list was intentionally made large and redundant for pedagogical reasons (!!!)
* The SMSG system postulates summarized: *the Ruler Postulate, the Ruler Placement Postulate, the Plane Separation Postulate, the Angle Addition Postulate, the* [*Side angle side*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_angle_side) *(SAS) Postulate, the Parallel Postulate (in* [*Playfair's form*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair%27s_axiom)*), and* [*Cavalieri's principle*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalieri%27s_principle)*.*

So, that is likely exactly where your text's idea to posit SAS as a postulate stems from.

* Summary of postulates of a slightly later system, UCSMP: [*point-line-plane postulate*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-line-plane_postulate)*, the* [*Triangle inequality*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_inequality) *postulate, postulates for distance, angle measurement, corresponding angles, area and volume, and the Reflection postulate. The reflection postulate is used as a replacement for the SAS postulate of SMSG system.*

Note that they eliminate SAS but replace it with some other postulates that boil down to the same thing.

"Do I need to take topology before taking functional analysis, measure theory, stochastic processes and differential geometry?","It would be nice, but you don't have to. Even if you're doing graduate level analysis, most textbooks will cover just enough topology for what you need when you go into Local compact Hausdorff space."
"Do I need to take topology before taking functional analysis, measure theory, stochastic processes and differential geometry?","Measure theory isn't really that topology heavy and I can't imagine stochastic processes are either. For differential geometry and functional analysis especially though, topology is mandatory to know."
"Do I need to take topology before taking functional analysis, measure theory, stochastic processes and differential geometry?","You need topology. General measure theory requires you understand abstract topological spaces and metric spaces very well, the basic objects of functional analysis are topological vector spaces, and you need the language of abstract spaces to understand them. 

Very basic differential geometry (i.e. just curves and surfaces) might not require so much topology, but for promoting to smooth manifolds, you absolutely need both point set and algebraic topology."
"Do I need to take topology before taking functional analysis, measure theory, stochastic processes and differential geometry?","I dont think an entire course is necessary, but you need to have the basic concepts of topology. Some quick introductory video should be enough. Often this introduction is provided when starting measure theory or differential geometry, but I wouldnt count on it."
"Do I need to take topology before taking functional analysis, measure theory, stochastic processes and differential geometry?","As others have said, it's not *completely necessary,* however, if you're doing a masters, I still highly recommend it. European masters programs are a little different, but in the US, it's considered pretty negative for a student's application to not have topology on it. It generalizes analysis so much and becomes a much more foundational way to talk about a general space. Maybe some European masters students can chime in, but in my American experience, I saw several schools that required topology, analysis, and algebra for applications."
"Do I need to take topology before taking functional analysis, measure theory, stochastic processes and differential geometry?","It depends on how the classes are structured. With functional analysis for example it's possible to have a basic course that doesn't use a whole lot of topology, but such a course will necessarily be nonconceptual in some places and also somewhat limited in scope. As an example: you can define weak convergence of sequences in Hibert spaces without actually having the weak topology, but it's of course more conceptual to define it as convergence in the weak topology. Moreover there are places in functional analysis where sequences are not sufficient and you need to consider more general notions like nets -- at these points you run into issues without topology. You find some books and courses that do functional analysis in this way - especially at the undergrad level.

Similarly one might study classical differential geometry without a whole lot of topology, but you'll have a hard time defining manifolds or bundles without topology. At some point you'll also start bumping into some algebraic topology.

That said you really don't need a full course just on topology for these. At my uni the graduate courses for example simply start with a week of topology (in case someone has avoided the topic up to that point, comes from a uni where they couldn't take it or whatever) and that's perfectly fine. Just pick up a book and read about the basic notions of topology a bit (topological spaces and their constructions, continuity and convergence, separation axioms, compactness, nets and maybe filters) and you should be fine.

This book for example explicitly aims to cover the necessary background for other courses, and you probably won't even need all of it: [https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-09680-3](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-09680-3)"
"Do I need to take topology before taking functional analysis, measure theory, stochastic processes and differential geometry?","If you had a good enough analysis course (topology on R^n or metric spaces), that’s good enough.

But it shouldn't be, by the definition that you are trying to prove -- it should be 3.  But it can't be.  

That is a proof by contradiction."

"This might be silly for most of you, but I'm looking for a function where, when applied to two numbers, the ratio between the results is 3.",">Is this even possible?

In general, no. If I understand you correctly, you want someone to come up with a function f that, when called twice with parameters x and y respectively, produces f(x)/f(y) = 3, but you have no control over what the inputs are or how they might be related. What if x=1 and also y=1? A mathematical function maps each input to  a particular output; you can't get f(1)=1 the first time you call it, and f(1)=3 the next time.

If you know what the inputs are ahead of time, you can of course construct a function that produces a ratio of 3 for those inputs, but functions don't maintain any state -- they have no memory of the result of previous calls."
"This might be silly for most of you, but I'm looking for a function where, when applied to two numbers, the ratio between the results is 3.","I don't think it's possible as stated (for reasons given in other responses). But if we change things a little you may (or may not) find something you need.

First let's start with a multivariate function f(x,y). Now, given the two variables at the same time (and giving two variables back) we can ensure that the output matches the required criteria. 

The simplest (which you have already rejected) is the constant output: f(x,y)=(3,1).

Next up we can fix the output to only one of the inputs: f(x,y)=(x,x/3)

If this still isn't good enough let's take the average of the inputs and make the first output a little bigger than the average and the second a little smaller (but in the ratio 3:1). The average is (x+y)/2. A little bigger might be 2(x+y)/2=x+y. Smaller (but keeping the desired ratio) might be (x+y)/3. So out function would be f(x,y)=(x+y,(x+y)/3).

Does any of that help?"

f is the distance between a point of your graph and its projection on the x-axis."
Finding the closest point to the origin on y = 1-x^2,"Imagine your parabola y = 1 - x^2. When you look at |1 - x^2|, you're really just looking at |y|. That number tells you how far the point (x, y) on the curve is straight up or down from the x-axis (like its height, ignoring whether it's above or below). But the distance to the origin (0,0) isn't just about the height (y); it's also about how far the point is sideways (x). The real distance is like the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides x and y, calculated as sqrt(x^2 + y^2), or sqrt(x^2 + (1 - x^2)^2) for points on your parabola. So, minimizing |1 - x^2| just finds points closest to the x-axis, while minimizing sqrt(x^2 + (1 - x^2)^2) finds the points truly closest to the origin."
Finding the closest point to the origin on y = 1-x^2,"Here's a simple counterexample to your thinking.

Consider this parabola whose vertex is at x = 1, y = -1:  y = (x - 1)\^2 - 1

Your procedure is finding the coordinates of the vertex. You're finding where y is minimum.

But this parabola goes THROUGH the origin at a point to the left of the vertex. That is obviously the point on the curve closest to the origin because that point has ZERO distance from the origin.

Do you see the difference between ""minimum y"" and ""distance from the origin""?"
Finding the closest point to the origin on y = 1-x^2,"The distance d of a point from the origin is equal to √(x²+y²)

Solve for what value x minimizes the equation and then you can find the y by plugging that x back into the origin equation

The minimum will be a point where d'(x)= 0 and d''(x) is positive"
Finding the closest point to the origin on y = 1-x^2,"Minimizing |f(x)| gives you the point closest to the x axis not the origin, to find the point closest to the origin you need to minimise sqrt(x^2+(1-x^2)^2)"

Nope. It tells you the distance between a point and the x axis (the distance between the point and whatever point on the x axis it's closest to). You're looking for the distance between a point and the origin, which is a _particular_ point on the x axis."
Help. I’m trying to help my kid on her homework. How do I find the area of two triangles (out of 4) in a quadrilateral?,"Is this a parallelogram, or just a random quadrilateral?

Help with statistics,"> upon getting the pity pull, it goes back to 0 out of 0 attempts at pulling a rare mod for both the pity and the 2.5% chance

_If_ the game is actually rolling independently for each pull attempt (what it generally means when something has a 2.5% chance of dropping), then there's no sense in which anything ""resets"" for the 2.5% chance. Each and every pull has an equal, 2.5% chance to result in a rare, with the exception of the 151st pull after a string of 150 losses. But the 150th pull after 149 losses and the very first pull after a pity pull have the exact same 2.5% chance of giving you a mod.

> it takes 5000 occurrences to start to approach stated value

I'm not sure what you mean here. Where did 5000 come from? What stated value?"
Help with statistics,"I don't think I understand what either of you are saying. From your description, you're right that, out of a successive 150 (non-pity) pulls, the ""expected"" number of mods you will get is 3.75 on average. More precisely, if you pull 150 times, you have:

* a 2.2% chance of getting 0 mods (→ a pity pull on the next try)
* an 8.6% chance of getting 1 mod
* a 16.5% chance of getting 2 mods
* a 20.8% chance of getting 3 mods
* a 19.6% chance of getting 4 mods
* a 14.7% chance of getting 5 mods...

and your chances keep going down from there. The 2.5% chance is **always** the same, except on the 151st pull after 150 losses.

If he is finding that he gets 0 mods on 150 consecutive pulls significantly more often than this, then the game might simply be lying to you about your chances."
Help with statistics,"There is a 1 - (1 - 0.025)^150 = 97.7% chance you'll get a rare without using the pity pull. In other words, for every 100 rares, I expect about 2 of them will require pity pulls.

If it feels like less than that, you can bring some data here and statistics can be done. A number of ""how many times I use the pity pull vs don't use"" would be enough. Without that data, there's not much to say."

Infinity is a weird concept. But the probability always remains above 0% and we have literally a never ending supply of flips. Which means eventually a heads will come up. In fact an infinite number of heads will come up because we will never run out of flips, there is no last coin toss. 

Looking at a fair coin as a separate example we cannot guarantee a heads given any finite number of flips, the odds of not getting a heads trend towards 0 but the odds never actually make it there. The odds of never getting a heads hits zero at infinity flips.

Can someone solve this for me?,Im sorry I didn’t see when I posted. Just the first x is on square everything else is normal. |x^2 - 2x - 8| = a
Can someone solve this for me?,"I’m going to assume it’s supposed to read

> |x^(2) - 2x - 8| = a. 

The graph of

> y = a

is a flat horizontal line at height a.

The graph of

> y = |x^(2) - 2x - 8|

looks like a parabola where the bit that would be under the x axis has been folded up a bit. 

Note that this touches the x axis in exactly two places: x = -2 and x = 4 (factorise the quadratic to see why). 

For the original equation to have four solutions, you need the y = a horizontal to cross the curve once before x = -2, twice between x = -2 and x = 4, and once again after x = 4. Drawing the graphs might help you see why. 

So obviously a must be greater than zero. And, in fact, so long as a > 0, we know that there will be at least two crossing points. The interesting bit is whether or not you get any crossings between x = -2 and x = 4. If the flat line passes over the crest at x = 1 then it won’t touch it at all, if it glances the crest then you only get one crossing here (for a total of 3), but if the flat line goes under the crest it will cross the curve twice here (for the total of 4 we want). 

So how high is the crest? Due to symmetry, we know it will occur at x = 1. So we can find its height by subbing x = 3 into that graph’s equation. Call the height h. Then:

> h = |1^2 - 2(1) - 8| = 9. 

So we need 0 < a < 9."
Can someone solve this for me?,"Note we only get solutions for ""a >= 0"". Complete the square:

    a  =  |x^2 - 2x - 8|  =  |(x-1)^2 - 9|    <=>    (x-1)^2 - 9  ∈  {±a}

Why don't any books define limits as relations (explicitly)?,"Because ternary relations are also seen as awkward.

We're already pretty used to defining things as functions when they *could* [a priori] have two distinct outcomes, and then showing those functions are ""well-defined"". We do it any time we have operations on equivalence classes, for instance. We define fraction addition by ""a/b + c/d = (ad + bc)/bd"" and *then* we show that different ways to express your rational number as a fraction lead to the same answer.

It's a common enough trend that people are comfortable with that method of exposition, over the ""start with a relation, prove the relation is indeed functional"" one. (But you're absolutely right, it is somewhat 'backwards'.)"
Why don't any books define limits as relations (explicitly)?,">You end up with this really awkward presentation where you go through this phase of not knowing what kind of object a limit ""is"" to showing it does happen to be like a function. Then you move on, using it like a function.

I get what you're saying but I don't see the need to get hung up on that. I think you can totally just prove that any limit is unique before stepping into any ""lim f(x) = "" notation

Write the formal definition as ""L is *a* limit if etc etc"", then prove that if you have one limit, you can't have a different limit on that same function at the same location. Now you can update it, ""L is *the* limit iff..."", no need to even look back"
Why don't any books define limits as relations (explicitly)?,"The standard definition of limits (to be precise, the notion that ""f approaches the limit l near a"") is a predicate in three free variables. One can think of any n-ary predicate as being really very much like an n-ary relation. 

You can do this even when the predicate doesn't actually literally define a relation such as with proper-class-sized relations (for example, the equinumerousity relation, aka existence of a bijection, on the class of all sets is still very much thought of as an equivalence relation even though it doesn't literally exist).

But the parameters in the limit definition are bounded to at most reals or real-valued functions so the actual existence of the relation in your set-builder notation is immediate.

We don't want to get into the habit of instantly assuming that for any predicate the set of tuples satisfying it forms a set because that turns out not to be true. Take the equinumerousity example above. Define

R = {(x,y)| There exists a bijection f such that f maps x 1-to-1 onto y}

x R y ↔ (x,y) ∈ R

R is exactly like an equivalence relation. It's reflexive, symmetric, and transitive (that is, x R x, x R y iff y R x, and if x R y and y R z then x R z, for all sets x, y and z). But R doesn't exist as a set (provably); it's a proper class."
Why don't any books define limits as relations (explicitly)?,"This is the kind of stuff people think about in writing computer verified proofs, eg Lean. 

But I think in practice it’s clearer to handwave this subtlety and use the standard notation.

A similar thing occurs with big O/little o notation"
Why don't any books define limits as relations (explicitly)?,"Interesting thought. It is good to analyze mathematical concepts. I'll mention that the relation is best seen as a binary relation, ((R^R x R), R) think of (f,a) as related to L. 

Typically, we would confine our interest to say the limit of a class of function (piecewise continuous, analytic, etc) so it would be a relation on ((C^1 (X),X),R), for instance of continuously differentiable functions from X to R. We do use this notion to describe in particular the derivative. 

You'd have to go to functional analysis, differential geometry, other more advanced subjects where this abstraction gets used to bundle notions of limits. Usually, it's just not helpful to look at a general limit from this framework. 

Also, a more rigourous approach is to prove L is the unique limit before writing they are equal. Sounds like maybe your course was just being hand wavey."
Why don't any books define limits as relations (explicitly)?,"So if you want to be pedantic about it, *yes*, *technically* this is an abuse of notation. If one were being fully formal about it then you could define it as “Def: A number L is **a** [note that I say **a** limit and not **the** limit] limit as x approaches a of f(x) iff for all epsilon etc. Lemma: If f(x) has a limit as x approaches a, then the limit is unique. Notation: Denote lim_{x -> a} f(x) = L if the limit exists, which is justified by Lemma.”

Alternatively, you could use the notation in the definition itself, give the lemma, and then note as an aside that the lemma justifies the notation. Common mathematical practice is to lean towards the latter."
Why don't any books define limits as relations (explicitly)?,"I think the limit symbolism is unintuitive because we're really talking about convergence.

If x converges to a then f(x) converges to b

If x -> a then f(x) -> b"

Is there a Udemy course that teaches you enough math to understand topos theory and craft any philosophical discussion or theories about topos theory?,"I’m just going to copy paste my response to the last time you asked an almost identical question. If you want to learn, you have to put in the work. Also it’s not even clear what you mean by “philosophical discussion” when it comes to pure mathematics. 

You aren’t actually going to “learn” anything if all you do is watch 10 minute videos; you can only truly learn any skill by actually doing work. You would be better served by looking up the standard textbooks for whatever fields of mathematics you want to learn and following those and doing the problems in the backs of the chapters. Also, 10 minutes definitely isn’t enough time to explain any suitably advanced mathematical concept with any acceptable level of rigor.

Additionally, I’m not sure what you mean by advanced math in this context; there isn’t really a one-size-fits-all curriculum for mathematics. Many people take topology courses in their first year of university, and to be even more specific, there are many many subfields of topology, most of which require their own semester-long courses to teach.

Regardless, my recommendation is to use textbooks and do problems at whatever pace is best for your actual understanding."

Khan Academy is solid too but Imo Greene's lectures were much better for me personally than Sal's, he goes a lot more in depth in my experience. I managed to learn all of prealgebra with his help, and then went to college for algebra 1 + precalc 12. I actually just finished my precalc 12 class (did the exam today and got a 90). All of this was done in exactly a year and one month. 

If you have the time or can afford it, I would look at local colleges. My courses both had self paced options (I'm in Canada if it matters) and they were tuition free (so just student fees.) I find even the online self paced courses are really good at pushing you to learn as much as you can in 12-14 weeks. I was studying much more slowly alone with the pre algebra stuff. If you can't do that and are determined to self study I'd still recommend the resource anyway, but I can't really speak to the quality of the stuff past algebra 1 on his site.

Brute forcing a 4 digit combination,This looks like a post from someone who's just too lazy to try and solve a problem for their math homework. Doesn't really look like someone trying to learn math.
Brute forcing a 4 digit combination,"Suppose we could have any of the digits 0-9 including repeats. Then there are 10 digits and 4 of them so there are 10^4 = 10,000 combinations.

When doing maths it’s always nice to do a quick calculation like this, which I call a “sanity check”. We know that if our answer is correct it must be less than 10,000, since excluding cases where a digit repeats cannot possibly make the number of combinations larger, and similarly counting 1234 and 4321 as the same also will reduce the number of combinations.

What you described is actually a well known case, called the “choose” formula. Suppose we have n objects, how many ways are there to find r things from those objects? We’ll call this nCr. 

For normal purposes, we can just look up nCr and plug the numbers in:

nCr = n! / ((r!) x (n - r)!)

Where ! is the “factorial”. For a factorial you multiply by every whole number from 1 to that number, for example: 3! = 3 x 2 x 1, and 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1.

So we can just plug numbers in and get the answer of 210, which is much less than 10,000 so it meets our sanity check!

In maths it’s also useful to be able to derive formulas so we know not only what works but why it works. Can you derive the formula for nCr? I’ll give you a hint:-

- n! gives you the number of different ways to rearrange n things. Suppose I have 4 things, then I have 4 options for what to put in the first slot, then 3 options for the next slot, 2 for the next, and then I must put whatever is left in the last slot, so we have 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 4!"
Brute forcing a 4 digit combination,"If it can be any 4-digit code, then it could be any number 0000-9999: 10,000 combinations

If the digits are distinct AND order doesn’t matter, then it is 10 choose 4: (10!) / (10-4)!4! = 10!/6!4! = (10x9x8x7) / 4! = 5040 / 24 = 210 combinations.


To get even more specific, let’s say it takes you an average of 1 second to try a combination.

A standard 4-digit code would take an average of 1hr 22to brute force, and a maximum of 2hr 44.

A non-repeating code would take an average of 42 minutes, and a maximum of 1hr 24

A non-repeating code where order doesn’t matter would take a maximum 3.5 minutes to brute force."
Brute forcing a 4 digit combination,"It's just the total number of permutations divided by the number of orders.

If we allow repetition, there are 10^4 permutations, or 10000

If we remove duplicates, it's 10!/6!, or 10\*9\*8\*7 =  5040 permutations

If we consider only the arrangements of the numbers, you just need to consider the ways you can arrange 4 things, which is 4! Or 24 arrangements

So for any combination of 4 numbers, there are 24 permutations we are counting.

5040/24 = 210

That's how many combinations there are

10!/(6!\*4!) = 210

Brute forcing a 4 digit combination,"I'm just spitballing here, but the factorial of a number is how many possible ways there are to arrange that number. When order does matter, there are 10^4 combinations (10 possibilities for each digit, then times 4 digits). Because the digits can be in any order, there will be 4! repititions of the 'same' number in a different order.

Not understanding field extensions,"the point is precisely that you don’t want all of R. as far as number theory is concerned it is a really horrifying beast. there are loads of interesting things in more manageable collections of numbers that don’t survive when you drown them in R, like how N has the concept of prime numbers."
Not understanding field extensions,"A few reasons.

C is a *very* big field. It contains roots for *all* of its polynomials. Sometimes that’s too many — maybe you only want roots for the polynomial x^2 + 5x + 7. Why use big field when small field do trick?

But that’s a fake reason. The *real* reason is that, when you construct the field generated by the roots, you get a field that possesses remarkable properties that tell you about how your polynomial is structured. Does it have repeated roots? Does it have any rational roots? What is the degree of this polynomial? How are the roots algebraically related to one another? The *Galois group* of this field tells you all about this.

In abstract Galois theory, you actually don’t study roots of polynomials. You study fields, and then obtain information about polynomials as a happy byproduct. Historically, polynomials were the original motivation — but then mathematicians ended up finding a cool connection between polynomials and fields, and now we have our modern theory. This is a huge theme in abstract mathematics. Finding and exploring connections between disparate objects."
Not understanding field extensions,">Like, if you need all these other numbers, why not just start with complex field to begin with?

Here's an analogy. You probably know the *fundamental theorem of arithmetic*: any positive integer can be written as a product of prime numbers, and this product is **unique**. Example: 75 = 3×5×5, and you can swap around the 3 and the 5s if you want, but other than that, there is **no** other way of writing 75 as a product of primes.

This is really useful, because it makes the concept of ""divisibility"" meaningful! If you want to find positive integer solutions to an equation like x(x+2)(x+6) = 9975, then you can argue e.g. ""the right-hand side isn't divisible by 2, **and therefore** the left-hand side isn't divisible by 2, and so x, x+2 and x+6 must be odd"". Or ""the right-hand side is divisible by 5, **and therefore** the left-hand side is divisible by 5, and so either x or x+2 or x+6 is divisible by 5"". This helps you narrow down your possibilities.

However, it crucially relies on our choice of positive integers. If you expand it to negative integers, then you could have written 75 = 3×5×5×-1×-1. If you expand it to rationals, you could have written 75 = 3×5×5×2×(1/2). If you expand it to real numbers, 75 = 3×5×5×π×(1/π)... and so on. Is 9975 divisible by 2 **in the real numbers**? Sure, but everything is divisible by (basically) everything in the real numbers, so you don't learn anything any more.

Here's a reason that's a bit more Galois-theory-specific:

>what if we just extend the field by adding the root to it? Great, now we have Q(<root 1>). And we can keep going! Q(<root1>,<root2>), etc. yay!

Galois theory isn't quite the study of **fields** \- it's the study of **field extensions**. So, for example, you're not just studying Q(i), you're studying the process of going **from** Q **to** Q(i) - more specifically, if you nail down Q in place (so nothing in Q can move), how much freedom does the rest of Q(i) have to move around (e.g. complex conjugation will keep Q nailed down in place but will send i to -i)? This means a few things:

* The smaller the extension is, the easier it is to understand the process. Going from Q to C means adding in a huge amount of extra numbers, which means it's harder for you to say anything concrete about it.
* The more numbers you add in, the more those numbers can interact with each other, which can place extra constraints on what you can do. For example, let's suppose you go from Q to Q(√2), and you then want to ""do"" something to √2. There is an operation very much like complex conjugation on this field extension: you can send √2 to -√2 (or, more generally, a + b√2 to a - b√2), and this preserves lots of very nice properties of the field extension. But **now** suppose you extend even further, and throw in a square root of √2, which I might as well call ∜2. **Now** you have the extra constraint (∜2)² = √2, i.e. √2 is the square of a real number. But squares of real numbers can't be negative, so you're no longer able to send √2 to -√2!

The take-home message is: you don't want **all** the numbers. You want as few numbers as necessary. The more numbers you have, the **less** freedom you have to explore the kind of structure **within** and the relationships **between** those numbers."

"With trig, how much should it feel like 'magic'?","Ideally, none of the identities are ""magic"". What that means is that, *in principle*, you don't have to remember the formulas for the identities, but instead, if you forgot, say, the formula for sin(a + b), you could reconstruct it from nothing.

In practice, most mathematicians have committed the important formulas to memory, so that they don't have to go to the trouble of reinventing them every time they need them.

For example, consider the identity sin^(2)x + cos^(2)x = 1. Will you agree that that one is *not* magic, and that if you forgot it was true, I could convince you by just drawing the triangle inside the unit circle and using Pythagoras? (If that *does* seem like magic, say so, and we can try to convince you that it's true in slow-motion.)

So, another example would probably help. Which identities mystify you? Pick one, and we can probably show you where it comes from, and how you could reconstruct it if you were on a desert island and forgot it."

The three most important identities (in my opinion, at least when doing Trig proofs) are all derived from Pythagoras's Theorem:

(Note that the argument for all the following trig functions is θ, but with Reddit formatting it's a bit tidier without it.)

The unit circle definitions of sin and cos give us a right-angled triangle with a hypotenuse of 1, an opposite side of sin, and an adjacent side of cos.

>Applying Pythagoras's Theorem to this gives us sin^2 + cos^2 = 1^2 , or just sin^2 + cos^2 = 1.

What happens when we divide this equation by cos^2 ? Let's find out:

>sin^2 / cos^2 + cos^2 / cos^2 = 1/cos^2 or, tidying up: tan^2 + 1 = sec^2

We get a similar identity if we divide the original equation by sin^2 :

>sin^2 / sin^2 + cos^2 / sin^2 = 1/sin^2 or 1 + cot^2 = cosec^2

I hope this helps demystify some of these identities."

To use math you only need to know the list of tools. Unless you want to create new ones (i.e. be a mathematician), intuition is mostly a memory aid. There's nothing super deep about a trig identity. You could learn a little deeper if you want to, but if you don't, don't. But that won't help you apply it in any way, you just have to know what it says.

The Pythagorean identity sin^2 + cos^2 = 1. I don't have to remember this, it comes from the pythagorean theorem, which I can derive, but its not like i'd ever forget it. I do forget the other Pythagorean identities, but those are just multiples of this.

Matrix multiplication. Look up ""rotation matrix."" If you know that rotation matrices correspond to rotation of the 2d plane, and you know that composition of these transformations corresponds to matrix multiplication, then you can derive the angle sum formulae and multiple angle formulae. From these it isn't too difficult to get to things like half angle formulae. Complex numbers are just glorified rotation matrices as well, so they can be used to make things more compact."

If they feel like total 'magic' then you have an issue eventually because you will forget them, be unable to apply them creatively, or to extend them when needed.

So try proving the law of sines, law of cosines, angle addition identities, sin\^2 + cos\^2 = 1, so go from there.  It's a mix of algebra and geometry.  Once you go through it you'll feel much more confident in using them.

Russian Roulette hack?,"Everytime you try you have a 17% chance of blowing your brains out.

Hope that helps."
Russian Roulette hack?,"Russian Roulette is probably too dramatic because the downside feels so high.

But you can change this to a simple game show. Each time you spin on the big wheel you either win $1 or lose everything and can't play anymore. You can use the same 90/10 odds.

So what's the optimal number of times to spin? And if it's not zero times (which it isn't) then why doesn't that reset after you've had a successful spin.

And that comes down to how much you've won already. Each time the reward of winning stays the same, but the cost of losing is increasing.

In your example it isn't obvious because $100 doesn't seem very high compared to death, but maybe you need $200 to buy medication for you baby. So you'd stop after two rolls.

In my example maybe it's a bit more clear that after about 10 rolls you are risking more than you expect to win with the next roll so that's about the time you stop."
Russian Roulette hack?,"Spinning once: upside +$100, downside death

Spinning second time: upside +$100, downside death *and -$100*

The upside stays the same but the downside grows every spin, so the balance of the decision changes with each choice.

To make it even more obvious, imagine you chose to spin and won a billion times in a row. Now you're holding $100billion. It's obvious at that point that $100 isn't worth stopping to pick up off the street, let alone risking your life anymore. So clearly at some point along the way as you continue to play, your value comparison slowly changes enough that you'd stop playing."
Russian Roulette hack?,You are missing the point -- the decision to play again after the 10'th successful cash-in is just as stupid as it was the very first time. Is that clear enough for you?
Russian Roulette hack?,"If you’re looking for an answer as to why someone who is willing to pull the trigger once wouldn’t do it indefinitely until they are shot the reason is the “value” of money decreases as you get more. 

For example he might need the first $100 to pay rent, feed his family, etc. if he’s broke but if he has won, say, 100 in a row, the value of an extra $100 on top of the $10,000 he’s won is significantly less"
Russian Roulette hack?,"The money grows linearly but the risk grows much more quickly. For example, suppose you win $1 per survival and have a 3/4 chance of surviving (just so the maths is a little easier).

- 1 play: $1 if you win, 1/4 chance of death

- 2 plays: $2 if you win, 7/16 chance of death

- 3 plays: $3 if you win, 37/64 chance of death

- 4 plays: $4 if you win, 175/256 chance of death

- 5 plays: $5 if you win, 781/1024 chance of death

It may be true that there’s some amount of money X which it’s reasonable to take a p% risk of death to gain X money, but not to take a (1 - p)^n chance of nX money.

It’s true that if, say, you survive the first 2 rounds then your probability of surviving 5 total rounds is the same as the probability of surviving 3 rounds if you’ve not yet survived any, but that’s why it’s best to have an a priori policy of “I will play N rounds and then stop” rather than an a posteriori policy of “Given I am alive I will play N more rounds”. The latter inevitably leads to death eventually. 

There’s also diminishing returns. I might take a 1/6 chance of death if it’s for a 5/6 chance of winning $1,000,000,000, but I wouldn’t take another 1/6 chance of death to win another $1,000,000,000 if I’ve already won once."

Russian Roulette hack?,"If you start looking at it from the other perspective, each time you spin it, there's a 1/6 chance to die. This is the ultimate loss, so all your previous successes are immediately rendered pointless if you fail a single time. This is not about horizon of expectations but ultimately it is about preventing a single loss at all costs while potentially maximizing your wins. 

So the best strategy would be to not play at all, because hitting the 1/6 on the first try kills you right away. Each subsequent play after winning has to return more than the previous one, because the risk to hit 1/6 is infinitely higher than not playing and thus being assured you won't hit the 1/6 - and you have won before already. So let's say the first $100 were because they guy has debts, the second $100 were to pay bills this month - what's coming next, what increasing use do the winnings have compared to risking to lose everything in one hit of the 1/6 chance? 

So you are right in #10 is the same as the first - probability-wise - which is why he needs a **damn** good reason to pull the trigger on attempt #10 instead of cashing out the 9 previous wins. The point of the game is not to play, it's to win and he won a lot already."
Russian Roulette hack?,"First, you got a 17% chance to kill yourself every time. But the main thrust of what you want to know is this.


P(probability of at least one success in n tries) = 1 - (1-p)^n

p-1 = 5/6 (chance to fail)


and n will be our number of attempts.

The bottom line is 12.63 attempts.

If you try 2 times, you will have (5/6)\^2 chance of not dying (69.44%)

4 times -> 48.22%

5 times -> 40.18%

10 times -> 16.15%

20 times -> 2.61%

This is basically the [birthday problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem) with N people and S birthdays. The probability that at least two people went to the same high school is approximately 1 - exp\[-N(N-1)/(2S)\]. Google tells me that N=30 and S=25000 are probably reasonable numbers. That gives me about 1.72%. So you'd expect at least two coaches to share a birthday in about 1 in 58 of these universes.

Many people take topology courses in their first year of university, and to be even more specific, there are many many subfields of topology, most of which require their own semester-long courses to teach. 

Regardless, my recommendation is to use textbooks and do problems at whatever pace is best for your actual understanding."
Udemy courses with 10 min videos to learn advanced math up to topology?,"what does ""up to topology"" even mean??? math isn't something you learn linearly and ""topology"" is incredibly vague."
Udemy courses with 10 min videos to learn advanced math up to topology?,"There's a split in mathematics between *practical* mathematics and *theoretical* mathematics, with the second one sometimes breezily called *higher* mathematics. And theoretical mathematics offers a huge challenge for online education. At present, we are only getting faint glimmers of how to teach theoretical mathematics without hands-on instruction.

The two parts have very different vibes, and getting used to the theoretical math style of thinking is a big challenge for a lot of students. It's a big conceptual shift. Practical math is about getting *an answer*, and it's fairly easy for a machine to check if an answer is right. But theoretical math is about *proving things*, and until recently machines have been very bad at telling whether a proof was right.

Just to help you get your bearings: all of high school mathematics except some topics in geometry are ""practical"" math. Practical also includes most of calculus. The boundary runs right through the middle of linear algebra and also through differential equations (though a whole lot of differential equations is practical). A lot of complex analysis (the part that is really a branch of calculus) is also practical.

But almost all the topics from there on use the theoretical style: abstract algebra, real analysis, topology, number theory, algebraic geometry, differential geometry, a whole lot of computer science (though CS has a big important practical area, of course), and so on and on.

Online educators face an enormous challenge when trying to teach theoretical topics like topology. I think we will get there eventually using proof-verifying software like LEAN and Coq; the ""Natural Number Game"" at [https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/leanprover-community/nng4](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/leanprover-community/nng4) is an early glimpse of what that kind of learning might be like. And that's just for the very basics of integer analysis; we are just not there yet with real analysis, abstract algebra, or topology. But maybe the story will be different ten years from now."

"Weight of the sum of n vectors / prooving that minimal distance of extended golay code G(24,12)2 is 8","Basically, that 11x11 grid of 0s and 1s (where adding is XOR) has a cool property. Its rows generate a code where the minimum number of '1's in any non-zero combination is 5. Because of this when you add n rows, the number of '1's you end up with has to follow the rule you found (at least 8-n for even n, 7-n for odd n). While this grid relates to building the famous extended Golay code G_24, proving G_24's minimum distance (smallest number of '1's in any valid codeword, besides all zeros) is 8 is actually much simpler using its cousin, the perfect Golay code G_23. G_23 has a minimum distance of 7. You create G_24 by taking G_23 codewords and adding one extra bit (a parity bit) to make sure every G_24 codeword has an even number of '1's. This process automatically bumps the minimum weight up from 7 (odd) to 8 (even), giving G_24 its famous minimum distance of 8 without needing complex proofs about sums of rows from your specific grid."

What's your opinion on this course and the other one from the same author?,"You won't reach ""conceptual fluency"" in all the domains that the course touches on in less than 8 hours. The Topology part for example doesn't appear to go into *any* actual topology as we'd usually understand the subject, and instead only talks some about the topology of the reals. Similarly real analysis finishes with completeness - it doesn't appear to go into limits (in some sense the core topic of real analysis), derivatives, integrals and ""approximation"" more widely speaking.

So to relate this to your 5 levels: you'll hardly see the formal definitions relevant to all these fields, and as such can't reach level 2 with it.

The course really attempts to cover *a lot* and falls short because of that. It's not realistic to cover all these topics -- they comprise something like 1-2 years worth of a math degree. Even if you drop a lot of detail from that, you'll still need a lot more time than just a few hours.

I'd recommend getting a ""proof book"". These are what beginning math students would read just before or in parallel to their first courses and they cover the very fundamentals of mathematics. Something like Houston's *How to think like a mathematician* for example is good. Another example that has *very* brief intros to many fields of mathematics is *Proofs* by Jay Cummings (it's also only 10 bucks or so). Another one to consider is Hamkins' *Proof and the Art of Mathematics*, it for example has a section explicitly on real analysis that covers some actual ground.

Notably all of these will have you *doing* actual mathematics, which is how you really learn the stuff."

And of course, d/dx( e^x ) = ln(e)*e^x |^x=0 = ln(e) = 1

This is what the source above is trying to say, but it is a bit terse/unclear if you don't already know what is going on."
Is the differention d/dx e^x = e^x only valid for x = 0?,"No. Base e is defined as being the unique real number so that if f(x) = e\^x then f'(0) = 1. Turns out that this implies that f'(x) = f(x), and the domain is the real number line. f'(x) is a function, not a single number."

I mean my current favorite method from Apostol is use the functional equation of log(x) and u sub to prove that log(x)=int 1 to x 1/t dt  and then from the Fundamental theorem of Calculus d/dx log(x)=1/x. From there defining exp(x) to be the inverse of log(x) ie log(exp(x)=x and exp(log(x)=x, the chain rule gives us 1/e\^x\*d/dx e\^x=1 which gives us e\^x-d/dx e\^x"

Proof of why e exists,"There is two completely different definitions of the number e, that happen to have the same value; the compound interest definition, and the calculus exponential definition.

It’s not too difficult to see the motivation for e in terms of compound interest AKA e -> (1+1/n)^n as n -> infinity. You probably remember this definition from algebra 2 or precalc.

It’s a little more challenging but still understandable with just elementary calculus to see the calculus definition of e. Define ln(x) as the integral from 0 to x of 1/t dt. It turns out starting from the definition of the natural log instead of e, is a lot simpler for the rest of the proofs.

Using the intermediate value theorem, you can show that there must exist some value e, such that ln(e)=1. This is the calculus definition of e, but it helps to prove some further properties about it.

Define exp(x) as the inverse function of ln.

Using implicit differentiation, y=exp(x); ln(y)=x; (1/y)y’=1; y’=y meaning the derivative of exp(x) is exp(x).

Finally we can show exp=e^x from: y=e^x ;ln(y)=ln(e^x );ln(y)=x*ln(e)=x*1; exp(ln(y))=exp(x); y=exp(x), through substitution y=e^x =exp(x). This does require deriving the log property of ln(a^b )=b*ln(a) however that isn’t too difficult (only requires chain rule), but it’s a little out of scope so i’ll leave that to you.

So I showed two different definitions of e, using just basic calculus, that should fit your understanding of the constant. What about showing that these two numbers are exactly the same. Well, unfortunately that is not as simple, and requires a tad bit of analysis to formalize. You can watch this guy prove it: [https://youtu.be/ziRPZvbN-Uc?si=-Dwm3PF49YClLkTG](https://youtu.be/ziRPZvbN-Uc?si=-Dwm3PF49YClLkTG)

Why do exponents curve back up as x -> 0?,"I'm not sure this is a great function to examine if you're trying to build intuition around exponentials, which are usually of the form f(x) = k^x for a constant k. 

Fractional exponents are the same things as roots, e.g. x^(1/2) = sqrt(x). When you multiply together numbers between 0 and 1, they get smaller, like (1/2)^3 < (1/2)^2 < 1/2. This leads to somewhat counterintuitive behavior where taking a large root of a small number, like the 100th root of 1/100, is actually pretty close to 1, because if you multiply 0.955 by itself enough times you'll get around 0.01

I doubt there's a good way to explain why it bottoms out at around 0.37 without calculus: the derivative of x^x is zero at 1/e, so you get a local minimum there."
Why do exponents curve back up as x -> 0?,"consider some small 1>c>0

smaller x makes x^c smaller (bigger numbers multiplied = bigger number)

smaller x makes c^x bigger (shrinking factor less applied)

hence both effects fight each other when we observe x^x with x going to 0 from right

exponentiation is overall a more ""powerful"" operation than multiplication hence c^x effect eventually begins to dominate creating the curve effect you see."
Why do exponents curve back up as x -> 0?,"As x approaches zero from the right, what's the limit? What are things raised to the zero power?"
Why do exponents curve back up as x -> 0?,"In calculus, there's a way of deriving a function that tells you the slope of some other function at values of x that are, usually, up to you to choose. The slope function (""derivative"") of the function you mention tells us that your function has a slope of 0 only when x = 1/e. This value is roughly 0.37, corresponding to where you see the bottom of the valley on the graph. So if you take values of x increasingly farther away in either direction from x =1/e, you will see the corresponding function values increase."
Why do exponents curve back up as x -> 0?,"If y=x^x then ln(y) =ln(x^(x))  = xln(x).


Differentiating 


ln(y) = xln(x) 


with respect to x on both sides implicitly gives 


y' / y = ln(x) + 1


So the derivative of y = x^x is 


y' = (ln(x) +1)y


Or


y' = (ln(x)+1) x^x


If you want to know why the curve ""curves back up"" for small positive x, ask yourself where this derivative changes sign.  Since x^x is nonzero for positive x, this must happen when 


ln(x) +1 =0


ln(x) = - 1


x = e^(-1).


That's where the curve has its bottom. 


Analyzing the derivative more carefully can answer other questions, but that's basically it.  The curve ""goes down"" from x=0 to x=e^(-1) because y' is negative there, and it ""goes up"" for x > e^(-1) because y' is positive there. "
Why do exponents curve back up as x -> 0?,"Hmm, what do you mean by 'why'?

If you calculate y=x\^x for each value of x, then draw it on the x y plane, then the dots will land on that curve. That's essentially what the graph means. 

So you can calculate some values yourself, like:

* x=0.01
* x=0.1
* x=0.2
* ...
* x=0.9

And punch each one into a calculator (so 0.01\^0.01 etc), and then you can graph them (perhaps by hand on paper or in a spreadsheet program) and see the points start to build up the shape of this curve.

\----

That said, usually when trying to learn about exponents, we investigate simplier functions like k\^x, with k being some constant number. 

Having both the base and the exponent vary at once by both being the same value (x) is a bit unusual."
Why do exponents curve back up as x -> 0?,"Consider any fixed k > 1, however large you want. Then for all x > k we have x^(x) > k^(x). Now for any such x we also find s smallest natural number that's smaller than x (it's floor(x)), call that number n(x). Then n -> inf as x -> inf. And because x > n(x) we also have x^(x) > k^(x) > k^(n(x)). Now the rightmost term goes off to infinity because it's just repeated multiplications of a number larger than 1 with itself, so the leftmost term must do so as well."
Why do exponents curve back up as x -> 0?,"Start out on desmos graphing these functions one at a time.

y = x\^2

y = -x\^2

y = x\^3

y = -x\^3

Look carefully at where the y value is when x is -2, -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1 and 2.

Also do y = sqrt(x) and y = -sqrt(x).

Now do y = log(x) and do y = 1/x and 1/(x\^2) as well, positive and negative.  Review the same x values above.  

Now do y = 2\^x, 2\^(-x), and then do y = 0.5\^x and -0.5\^x.  Look at the same values.  Try to guess what they will be before you graph it.

This will give you the intuition to figure out what x\^x might look like.  If you get stuck, try calculating some specific values by hand to think about it."

After two hours, you have 1/2 \* 1/2, after three 1/(2\^3). And so on. But after six or eight hours the changes will be imperceptible if you put concentration vs time in a linear scale, so a log concentration will show the same distance every hour. This might be useful if you want to model or visualize how some other factors affect plasma concentration, for example urine acidity (which itself is also logarithmic!) in the excretion of amphetamine by the human body.

Why write logarithms?,"Since exponentiation can be understood as repeating multiplication, the logarithm of a number tells you how many time you repeated. In your example of 2\^3=8, the 3 tells us that we multipled 3 twos together to get 8.

This becomes useful in processes that involve multiplication. In biology, cells divide in 2. So if you start with a single cell and let it do its thing, after several generations, you'll have a bunch of cells. The logarithm tells you the number of generations. 

Bank interest is also computed by multiplying the amount of money you have (or are borrowing) by the interest rate. If the interest is compounded (i.e. multiplied) monthly, then we might want to know how many months it will take to pay off a loan or to reach a savings goal. The logarithm tells us the answer."
Why write logarithms?,its just a notation. look up triangle of power from 3blue1brown for an alternative notation. its not official but it makes much more sense
Why write logarithms?,"You might be a little confused cause other math operations are easy to calculate. 3x=7 implies x=7/3, which is a number you can use. One of the reasons logarithms are useful is because we have methods to compute log(x) for any x>0 so we can simply work with logarithms that have easily understood properties knowing that our final answer will be something we compute. We could always write x^3 as x*x*x but that would be annoying when we can simply write it in an easier form."
Why write logarithms?,"I have the same sentiment towards logarithms. I have yet to really get a grasp on their use, but....

He's my 2 cents anyways:
I've just recently started my journey of learning higher levels of math, and have recently gone through Khan academy's lesson on logarithms.

From what I understand, logarithmic expressions ARE exponential expressions. So 2^x=8 is the same as log_2 (8). It's just another way of writing the expression. But in doing so we can more clearly see that we can apply the change of base rule in logarithms. So log_10(8) / log_10(2) is the same as log_2(8). Which is 3.

Not all calculators can solve for custom bases, some only deal with base 10 and base e. So in changing to either base 10 or base e, you can then put it into a calculator and get the answer.

Other than that, I'm not sure yet..."
Why write logarithms?,"it's notation that expresses an exponent, which is a value you might want to interact with/manipulate independently. what exactly are you trying to say here?"
Why write logarithms?,"2\^x=8 is not log\_2(8). It is an equation equivalent to the equation x = log\_2(8). By itself log\_2(8) is just a number. Now you can use this number in ways you wouldn't be able to use the equation 2\^x=8. For example you can say ""What is 1 + log\_2(8)"" instead of ""let x be the solution to 2\^x=8, what is 1 + x""."
Why write logarithms?,you need logs to write the solution of an equation where x appears in the variable. 5=3\^x. so the solution is x=log3(5).
Why write logarithms?,Most growth is exponentially in nature.  Expressing that growth as a log linearizes the growth so we can more easily work with the numbers algebraically.
Why write logarithms?,"That's true once you take the lg of both sides. The steps getting there do matter in math.

Fwiw, teachers will want to see work."
Why write logarithms?,"While all the other answers are correct, you might want to look up why logarithms were created (search for Napier). 

Long story short, there exist log tables. In early times (before calculators) they provided a much faster way to multiply/divide large numbers. 

If you want a*b where a and b are very large numbers, then you can look up a and b in the log table, find log a + log b, and look up that value in the antilog table. 

It took Napier decades to compile his log table. 

Unfortunately, the use of log tables has been washed out with very powerful calculators (the one you're holding) becoming common. 

I was taught log tables as a part of my chemistry class, but I'm also rusty now."
Why write logarithms?,"One thing I didn’t see talked about. If anything grows exponentially with some variable, you can spot it as a straight line if you don’t plot the function but the log of the function."
Why write logarithms?,"A long long time ago, we didn’t really have much maths notation. We’d write things in words, so the solution to the equation x^2 + x = 1 would be expressed as “the number, when squared, then added to itself, gives 1”. Very hard to read! And what if I had x^2 + 2x = 1? In sentence-form, it’s much harder to notice the extra “2” in the equation. But also, having the math notation means that I can start doing manipulations on the equations in a way that’s difficult in sentence form. 

Now with logs, it’s a similar thing. Why write “the solution to e^x = 3” when I can just write log(3)? Now I’m free to write things like log(3) + log(4) which would be difficult to express in sentence form. Furthermore, it’s common to take data that exhibits some “exponential scaling” to “log space” and so performing algebraic manipulations in “log space” requires expressions such as log(2). Converting to log space is often convenient because it converts multiplication into addition so you can use all the tools of linear algebra in log space.

In general, giving a name (or notation) to a new concept gives you *power* over that concept, and not doing so leaves you powerless. Even more generally, it’s the reason we have *words* in languages, or company logos: imagine having to explain the notion of crisps to someone who is not familiar with the concept. But once everyone is familiar with it, just saying “crisps” is a massive simplifier."
Why write logarithms?,My favorite number is log(3)/log(2). How would *you* write that down?
Why write logarithms?,"Well it’s used for a lot of things , for example it can simplify exponential functions and make them easier to graph"
Why write logarithms?,"Even ignoring all the many practical applications detailed here, logarithm rules can be written more concisely in log notation than exponents. How would you write something like this your way:

`logₐ(xy) = logₐ(x) + logₐ(y)` 

?? 

Using exponential notation is unnecessarily convoluted. 

A similar example from calculus -no one uses Newton's notation except to introduce the subject and prove derivatives rules. When applying derivatives rules, Leibniz notation is more concise and is widely used."
Why write logarithms?,"The notation takes the place of a real value that may be irrational.   Using decimal expansions of irrationals in algebraic manipulations is obtrusive.

This way, you have a logarithmic expression as a solution. You pass that to one of your minions to find an actual number because looking up logarithms is beneath your pay grade."
Why write logarithms?,">For example, 2\^x=8 is log₂8

They are not the same. 2^(x) = 8 is an equation. log₂8 is just an expression, just like how 2+2 is an expression. 2+2 evaluates to 4, log₂8 evaluates to 3.

This may sound pedantic, but this is one of the reason why they're useful. You can't just throw 2^(x) = 8 in a calculator and get a number out, how do you find x? You use logarithms.

2^(x) = 8

log₂2^(x) = log₂8

x\*log₂2 = log₂8

x\*1 = log₂8

x = log₂8

and then use a calculator to see that log₂8 = 3 which means x = 3"
lots of maths test in high school and i am not really acing them,"Well, it's quite simple, if you know how binary numbers work. The first digit (from the right) is 1, the next 2, then 4, then 8, then 16 and so on. If you want to convert a number, lets say 57, you start with the largest power of 2 and then check if the next one fits:  
32 fits: 1  
32+16=48 which fits: 11  
48+8=56 which fits: 111  
56+4 is too big: 1110  
56+2 is too big: 11100  
56+1=57 so the number is 111001.  
If you want to do this with numbers between 0 and 1, it gets a little harder, since you have to figure out if it's above/below a half, then quarter, then eighth and so on. In that case you can ""cheat"" by using a piece of paper with a scale and folding it in half a bunch until you hit your number."

Do we say Aleph-null (ℵ₀) minus 1 = ℵ₀ or undefined?,https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_number#Subtraction
Do we say Aleph-null (ℵ₀) minus 1 = ℵ₀ or undefined?,"> (ℵ₀ - 1) can be the Naturals without ""1."" (removing an element). So, the set (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...) can be assigned (ℵ₀ - 1).

I'm not sure that this step is valid, despite ultimately leading you to the correct conclusion anyway. That is to say ""(ℵ₀ - 1) = ℵ₀"" is true, but the proof you gave of it is incorrect. The set (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...) is known to have cardinality ℵ₀, so by declaring (defining?) it to (also) have cardinality (ℵ₀ - 1), you're presupposing the conclusion you're trying to prove.

It's not clear that ""removing an element"" is the right intuition for what (ℵ₀ - 1) means. To see why, consider using that same intuition for interpreting what (ℵ₀ - ℵ₀) means.

In particular, note that the set {1, 2, 3, ...} has cardinality ℵ₀ and the set {70, 71, 72,  ...} has cardinality ℵ₀, and so (ℵ₀ - ℵ₀) = cardinality of the set {1, 2, 3, ...} with the elements {70, 71, 72,  ...} removed = 69. Therefore, we've ""proven"" that (ℵ₀ - ℵ₀) = 69.

Instead, I think the approach you want to take is to define subtraction in terms of the inverse of addition, keeping in mind that the result is going to be undefined in some cases. For example, within the natural numbers (which, recall, does not include negative integers), 6 - 7 is undefined."
Do we say Aleph-null (ℵ₀) minus 1 = ℵ₀ or undefined?,"Addition of cardinal numbers is well defined (https://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/cardinals.htm); you take two disjoint sets of the cardinality you want, take their union, and consider the cardinality of the new set. So ℵ₀ + 1 is equal to #( {0} U {1,2,3,...}) = ℵ₀. I'm not an expert, so idk if subtraction could be defined as the difference of sets? If so, yes the cardinality would be ℵ₀ as well. If not, well it might me undefined. Waiting for a set theorist to reply to this."
Do we say Aleph-null (ℵ₀) minus 1 = ℵ₀ or undefined?,Your logic is exactly right. Removing an element doesn't change the cardinality.
Do we say Aleph-null (ℵ₀) minus 1 = ℵ₀ or undefined?,"Why would it be undefined?   Legitimate question.   You showed you can associate the elements to the naturals.

It's not materially different than counting just half of the naturals, or all of the integers, or any number of other similar sets."

Imposter syndrome,"For contrast, in some European countries ""Real Analysis"" is the very first lecture in 1.semester aspiring students of pure mathematics have to take. All lectures are proof-based from the start, and students are expected to pick up proof-writing on-the-fly.

Granted, these countries teach a rough equivalent of US Calculus during the last year(s) of standard school curriculum, so it may not be a fair comparison. Even with that background, many struggle severely to adjust, and even later-on successful students need to re-take exams multiple times."

How many bathtubs can you fill with 800 bread rolls?,"The concept you want is *packing density*, specifically the [maximum packing density of a sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_packing), which is about 74%. Or perhaps it's more realistic to use the average packing density of a random packing, which is 64.5%.

With the lower number, a 0.357 L sphere will take up on average 0.357/0.645 = 0.553 L, so 800 will take up 443 L, filling 2.46 bathtubs.

If you can manage to achieve maximum packing density, that number goes down to 0.482 L per sphere, and 800 take up 386 L or 2.14 bathtubs.

Your rolls aren't spheres, but those numbers are probably pretty close to what you can achieve."

You can do the reverse too, and given an m and a b, you can create points on the chart.

I liken it a little to sports, which I love but am never innately good at, and seeing most of my peers get such and such techniques within minutes before my eyes, that I'd struggle with for years.)

There are lots of people who end up getting by fine, in some career, with minimal grasp of math. But you clearly are motivated to not settle for that limitation, which is every reason to continue to look for options."

I can’t understand math,"It is very common to have a strength in either English or Math but not both.  I’ve found that in HS people who are good at language but not math have difficulty with the precision of math.  In language, you can shift around and make sense of something from a different angle or if you have a different take or a different stream of logic it can still work out.  With math, especially at that level, it’s much more rigid.  You have to memorize the steps and follow the rules and if you mess up even a little it’s difficult to recover.  If you ever saw Avatar the Last Airbender, it’s like the episode “Bitter Work” where the airbender (infinitely flexible, mobile, and adaptable) has to learn earth bending (rigid, direct, unchanging).  I always remember that episode when I encounter people that are good at one or the other.  Unfortunately the solution was essentially to think and act like an earth bender when circumstances requires, which may feel a bit like trying to write with your non-dominant hand.

Don’t punish yourself for wrong answers, though.  That frustration is a huge hinderance for learning and the nice thing about math is that it often only takes 1 little piece of information to go from zero to 100% so you may be closer than you think to actually getting it."

I can’t understand math,"Saying that you don't understand isn't very helpful. You need to tell us what your specific problems are and what you don't understand. It would help us give way better advice that could directly help your specific situation.

Part of math is following instructions and having patience.

Stop trying to understand math. What you need to do is justvfollow the instructions. Write each step down as you go. Slowly and patiently. Step-by-step.

Here's something English and math share. You don't need to understand how to write a sentence to write a sentence and you don't need to know what fractions are to do fractions. I did multiplication for years without knowing that 7 × 3 is literally just 7 × 7 × 7 or 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3. I couldn't really hear or see when I was a kid. I just knew to memorize my multiplication tables. I now work with a bunch of engineers. For example, I asked an engineer recently how he understood the math to pass his math classes. He said he didn't understand the math. He just did it. Think to yourself... do you need to know the word ""the"" or ""a"" are articles of a sentence or what exactly a verb actually is? Plenty of people know how to read and write and speak English without knowing what a verb is or what an article is. Math and English are very abstract subjects. It's not like history class where you learn hard-facts and dates. If you read enough and speak enough English, eventually you'll learn enough intuition to just speak and write it. If you do enough math problems you'll learn enough intuition to solve math problem.

That's the secret. The more you do math, the more you learn intuition on how math works without defining every little thing.

Your teachers need to show you step-by-step what they are doing. And then you just need to copy it. And just use those steps by yourself. You need to take your time and be patient while doing the problems.


But I will leave you with one thing to help you ""understand"" math. Math is about proportionality. You get math through observation. For example, watch a car go down the road. This car is speeding down from Street A to Street B. The speed is a variable. Going from Street A to Street B can be summarized as distance. And notice that it takes a certain amount of seconds or minutes for the car to get from Street A to Street B. This can be summarized as time. That's how you get the speed, distance, and time formula. Math is about finding relationships and describing those relationships. Pure math doesn't show these descriptions... pure math spits out numbers and the theory on how to get outcomes. Pure math is a demonstration of how you can manipulate variables and numbers if that the math were to actually describe a relationship. There's nothing to truly understand beyond that point. It's just doing the math step-by-step and taking your time. If you have one variable on one side of the equation then you can move that variable to the other side of the equation. Sometimes the best idea is to NOT use numbers and instead use the variables/words in the equations and see where and how you can move those variables and words in the equation. 

Stop trying to understand. Do the steps. If you encounter a word problem, reword the word problem to a way you can understand. Like f(x) simply means ""Do function and plug in the x variable into the equation."" F(x) can sometimes also be described as the total outcome of the function. Try to find ways to describe something in your words. And use that every time you see that problem."
A math problem from D&D,"It's easier to calculate the probability of **failure**. With one d20, you have a 3/20 = 15% chance of failing. With two d20s, you fail if you fail at **both**, so 3/20 \* 3/20 = 2.25% chance of failing. Put another way: your chance of failure has dropped by 85%."
A math problem from D&D,"It might be easier to visualize with something like [https://anydice.com/program/3c74d](https://anydice.com/program/3c74d) .

That shows the distribution of rolls with advantage, then with just one dice.

At the bottom, you can see your example of trying to get a 4+ goes up to a 97.75% chance with advantage."
A math problem from D&D,"The short answer is, it's complicated because the equivalent numerical bonus is dependent on the DC of the roll, but for the most common DCs used in the game, it's somewhere between +3.5 and +4.  

Here are some links to math-y discussions about it:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/12e2248/calculating\_the\_value\_of\_advantage/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/12e2248/calculating_the_value_of_advantage/)

A math problem from D&D,"The way to work it out is to *square* your *chance of failure*. This will calculate your new chance of failure.

* So if you would fail half the time, now you fail a quarter of the time.
* Or if you would fail only on a nat 1, thats 1/20, so now it is 1/400.

If you want to use your calculator, then a procedure you can use is:

1. type in the chance of failure as a decimal (so divide the percentage by 100, e.g. 50% -> 0.5)
2. square it (so we'd get .25)
3. and then to convert it to success chance again, subtract it from 1 (or just subtract 1, and then ignore the negative sign) (so we get .75, or -.75 if we take the shortcut)
4. and you can recover the % if you multiply by 100 (so 75%)

\----

50% base chance is when the raw impact is the largest (+25% flat), and the other extremes are when you need a nat 1 or a nat 20, where it is just under a +5% chance flat.

* If you have a 5% chance, then advatnage gets you almost to 10%, but more precisely is 9.75%.
* If you have a 95% chance, then advantage gets you to 100%, but more precisely is 99.75%

These cases arguably matter less because it is a smaller aboslute change. Although arguably:

* *nearly doubling* your chance to succeed sounds very good (even though it is only from 1/20 to *nearly* 2/20)
* and *reducing your fail chance by a relative 95%* sound good too (a very likely 19/20 chance because an close to certain 399/400 chance)"
A math problem from D&D,"So the general way is to calculate what fails.  So If you need a 4 then a failure is (3*3)/(20*20) = 9/400 or 2.25% chance of failure so 97.75% chance of success. (compared to 85% with 1 die)


If you need an 11 then it's (10*10)/400 or 1/4= 25% chance of failure, compared to 50%."
A math problem from D&D,How many combinations win?  Only those in which BOTH dice lose are losers.  I think you can get this one easily.
A math problem from D&D,"Basically, when trying to roll over X on d20, there's an X/20 chance of failing (over 3 fails on 1-3 out of 1-20), so subtracting gives a 1-x/20 chance of success. 

When rolling with advantage, you only fail if both rolls fail, so the chance is (x/20)^(2) = x^(2)/400. Thus the chance of success is 1-(x/20)^(2).

For example, beating a 5 normally has a 1/4 chance of falling, or 3/4 of succeeding. With advantage, those become 1/16 and 15/16."
A math problem from D&D,"By and large, roughly speaking, give irvtake, etc...

Advantage cuts your chances of failure in half, disadvantage cuts your chances of success in half."
A math problem from D&D,"I literally made my math class calculate this as an assignment.  This is a spreadsheet I made them make:

I find it easier to calculate the chance of failure and subtract before dividing by all possible outcomes.  If you need a 6 then both dice have to be 5 or below to fail.  The chance of rolling a 5 or below on a d20 is 5/20.  Multiply by the other possibility (which is the same so square it) and you get 25 out of 400.  If this is your chance of failure, your chance of success is the other 375 out of 400 which simplifies to 15/16 or 93.75%.  I find it helpful to make a grid of the possibilities for a visual, though a 20x20 grid does take a minute.

If you figure out the success rate directly you have to deal with calculating an either/or probability (odds of dice 1 rolling a 1-6 + odds of dice 2 rolling 1-6 - odds of both rolling a 1-6) and that gets trickier"
A math problem from D&D,"Hi, I run a very small YouTube channel about the maths of D&D. I talk a lot about how advantage works in my video [002 The Great Weapon Mystery](https://youtu.be/CqMfCFd49b8), mostly in the context of great weapon master. Maybe it will help."
A math problem from D&D,"This is one of those times where it is easier to find the chance of failing than the chance of passing. Instead of thinking of it as ""one of the two d20s must be 4 or higher to pass"" try ""both of the d20s must be three or less"".

The chance for 1 d20 to be 3 or less is 3/20 (yes 85% but keep it as 3/20 so the marry is easier)

When you want the odds of something happening twice you multiply them together so 3/20 * 3/20 = 9/400. 

(If you want to be picky this only works when the two things are independent of each other, but that is how it works for dice so we are golden)

Anyway you now have a 9/400 chance to fail, stand it on its head and say 391/400 chance to pass. If your people want it in percent that comes to 97.75%

As for how to explain it... tell them to imagine they made a stupid mistake and dropped their mask in front of the guard, stupid mistake, wouldn't happen 85% of the time. But the guard happened to look away at just the right moment and totally missed it. So now you have to drop the mask again to get caught. That's a measure of advantage for you."
A math problem from D&D,"**Assumptions:** All dice are fair, and rolled independently.
***
**Definitions:**
* `n:` #dice rolled
* `m:` #faces on dice
* `Ek:` event that the maximum number is (at least) ""k""
***
For an nDm-roll (in D&D-notation), there are a total of m^n possible outcomes, each equally likely: It is enough to count favorable outcomes. As you noted, finding ""P(Ek)"" is hard, so consider the complement instead.

To get a maximum number less than ""k"", each die must roll a number from ""{1; ...; k-1}"". That is the same as doing an nD(k-1)-roll, since we are blocking the highest ""m-k+1"" faces. Using that result:

    P(Ek)  =  1 - P(Ek')  =  1 - (k-1)^n/m^n"
A math problem from D&D,"The biggest problem is that how much of an advantage advantage is depends on the number you are trying to beat. 

Using 10 as an easy example 50% odds straight and 75% odds with advantage. So advantage is a 25% advantage. 

Using 3 as your example 85% odds straight and about 98% odds at advantage so advantage is only a 13% advantage in this case. 

And of course if a check is impossible (a 20 fails) or guaranteed (a 1 succeeds) then there is no advantage to having advantage.

Without checking all the possibilities i believe that the maximum advantage of advantage is in the middle, at 10, for 25% and the minimum is 0."

"How to find the simplified square roots of big numbers like 999, 1001, 1002? Can't find it anywhere","You'd factor the number and pull out any squares. So, 999 is 3^3 \* 37, so the square root is 3 sqrt(3\*37) or 3sqrt(111).

1001 is 7\*11\*13, so it won't get any nicer.

1002 is 2\*3\*167, which also wont get nicer."
"How to find the simplified square roots of big numbers like 999, 1001, 1002? Can't find it anywhere","You're looking for *prime factorisation*.

For 999, the process looks like this:  
- 999=3•333  
- =3•3•111  
- = 3•3•3•37=3\^3•37
- 37 is prime - root(37) is a bit over 6, so if it were composite, it'd need to have a factor of 2, 3 or 5 but it doesn't.

You can pull out *two* matching prime factors to get *one* factor outside the root. √(3•3•3•37)=√3•√3•√3•√37. The first two √3s multiply, and I get 3•√3•√37. That's the furthest I can break it down, unless I combine the roots to get 3•√111.

For 1001, it breaks down into 7•11•13. You can't pull anything out of the root, every component is still under a square root sign. Similarly, for 1002, it breaks down into 2•3•167, and you can't pull anything out."

Here, you’ve got a square factor of 3^2 and a pair of distinct prime factors. So we root the square and leave the other parts inside the radical

Similarly:

There are no squares in this factorisation. So nothing simplifies/gets outside the radical. So we just get sqrt(1001)."

Is there a way prove squaring sqrt(x^2+y^2)=4 doesn't introduce new zeroes for x and y?,"So, for everyone commenting trying to see what OP is asking, think about the equation x=1 which learly has one solution.  If you square both sides you get x^(2) = 1 which has two solutions.  Teaching precalc or whatever we call these ""extra"" solutions that arise when you perform a non-injective operation on both sides of an equation extraneous solutions.  Sometimes these arise in solving equations with radicals, like x+2 = sqrt(x-1) + 6 where squaring both sides is a reasonable way to begin.  I just made that up so no idea if it has any real solutions or if squaring introduces extraneous ones, but that's the idea. 


To OP: if you wanna solve something like


 f(x) = g(x)


 by squaring both sides, the extraneous solutions would arise from the fact that the equation 


(f(x))^(2) = (g(x)) ^2 


is actually equivalent to the statement


 f(x) = g(x) or f(x) = - g(x)

It also gives you a chance to let them know that you've had some personal challenges, and that you are concerned about your work -- that you haven't just blown it off.

Talk to them -- in person, not email."
failing math,"As others have said, talk to a teacher or guidance counsellor.  

I *could* tutor you, anyone on Reddit who knows math *could* tutor you.  Text replies are generally not enough so a VC to be able to see the work you are doing is probably the most effective way.  As a HS student you do *not* want to do that with a random Redditor, and most respectable Redditors who are likely safe to do that with would probably understand that it is not a good idea and say to talk to someone in person, a verified tutor from a tutoring service, fellow student.  So just go do that and don't open a video or voice call with a random person from reddit especially as a minor, there are messed up people out there. 

Talk to your teacher, explain everything, tell them you want to do better and then try your best to do better."
failing math,"Your teachers are human too. They understand struggle, to be frank they've probably been through worse than you. Like others have said, talk to someone about it. School counsellor is top priority, after that your year coordinator if you have one, and last but not least your teacher themselves. Ideally all of them.

It might take some tutoring or some extra work, but 60% on whatever assessments you have left is absolutely achievable and chances are they'll take your mental health into consideration in one way or another."
failing math,"I’m really sorry you’re going through this. First, talk to your teacher or tutor. Be honest about what’s been happening. They might be more understanding than you think.

I need help learning and understanding fractions,"Because both 3's are on the top. Cancelling requires one on top and one on the bottom, because something divided by the same thing equals 1 and therefore has no net effect on the multiplication."
I need help learning and understanding fractions,"If you multiply by three, and then divide by three, the threes cancel out and you can cross them. If you multiply by three, and multiply by three again, you're multiplying my 9 in total."
I need help learning and understanding fractions,"Fractions are just division. You're dividing the top number by the bottom.

This is why you can cancel things sometimes: multiplying by a number and then dividing by that same number doesn't actually change anything, so you can just get rid of both. 

In your example, (3/7) × (3/4), you can't cancel the 3's because they are both on top and therefore multiplying each other instead of one dividing the other."
I need help learning and understanding fractions,"It might be easier to understand if we just rearrange the work a tiny bit:

Do you agree that 8 times 3 is the same thing as 3 times 8?  Well we can rearrange all that working like so (3x3x8x9)/(4x7x8x9) and now we can quickly see that both the top and bottom have 8x9 in common.  Well any number divided by itself is 1 so we can reduce the (8x9)/(8x9) parts to just 1.  Multiplying anything by 1 get's us back to that same number so we're just left with (3x3)/(4x7) or as you wrote it (3/7)x(3/4).  The same thing!"

dividing fractions the keep change flip thing is real you keep the first fraction change the divide sign to multiply and flip the second one upside down

now the whole simplifying part before multiplying yeah that can get weird like if you see two 3s you might think hey just cancel em out right but it only works if the 3s are across from each other like one on the top left and one on the bottom right or top right and bottom left that’s when they can cancel diagonally

if the two 3s are like both on the top or both on the bottom or even sitting straight across from each other like top over top or bottom over bottom you can’t just cross em out like that

you kinda gotta think of it like you’re allowed to reduce a number on top with a number on bottom but not two tops or two bottoms that’s the vibe"
I need help learning and understanding fractions,"It can help to think of a fraction as just an integer number of a *thing* where that thing is a third or a quarter or a fifth. Try not to think of   a third as a math problem; but just the name of an object like an apple.

""One apple plus four apples is five apples.""
""One third plus four thirds is five thirds.""
Don't worry about what this thing called ""a third"" is until after the addition.

Now one *apple* plus three *bananas* is no number of apples. If a ""third"" is an apple and a ""fifth"" is a banana you can see that directly adding them and getting an answer in terms of apples (or bananas) isn't happening. You have to convert them into *like things* (thinks that are alike) be that apples, bananas, or some third species."

Math is basically a giant skill tree (or map), and if you miss the prerequisite topics, you're gonna have a bad time.

I know there are people who can just memorize formula/problem types and the steps to solve them without really understanding anything, but if you aim for a degree in CS in the future, having an intuition behind the logic of the problems is a huge advantage."
math is shitt,"First off. Shit is spelled with a single t.  Second, you will want to discover the comma and other connectives, or those good marks you speak of, are likely going to disappear rather quickly.

Next, if you want to be good at trigonometry, I'd suggest practicing. If you are not taking a trigonometry-specific course, you will want to do so. These come in two flavors, very broadly speaking, pre-calculus will cover trigonometry in a useful way in terms of learning how to manipulate the objects of interest and prepare you to use Calculus in regards to them. 

There are also Trigonometry and Geometry courses. These will intuit the geometric beauty of trigonometry, and usually focus more on the planar geometric aspects. 

For your own time, you need to figure out the minimal number of rules that you need to memorize to derive any of the trig identities. This is going to do two things for you. It will make you a stronger student if you don't have to memorize every single little detail. It further teaches you about how to use memory efficiently, something you will be doing in your stated career interest.

It also sounds like you need to revisit algebra, because solving for x and solving for theta using some rules is rather analogous philosophically."

Negative Radicals,"Yes, more specifically the property x^(ab) = (x^(a))^(b) can fall off/cause issues when x is negative"
Negative Radicals,"With real numbers, even roots of negative numbers are undefined (eg. sqrt(-2) or (-3)^(1/4)) since there’s no number you can multiply by itself to get a negative number. This means [(-2)^2]^(1/6) is not equal to [(-2)^(1/6)] ^2 since the sixth root of -2 is undefined so unlike positive radicals, the order matters so the same rules don’t always apply."
Why is 0^0 is 1?,"For a simple intuition: view powers as ""how often to multiply by the number"". Everything is 1 times itself, so you can write 0^(0) =1•0^(0) meaning you multiply 1 by 0 0 times, which means you don't multiply it by 0."
Why is 0^0 is 1?,"If you are coming from a combinatorial perspective, then for non-negaitve integers a and b, the value a^(b) can be defined as the number of functions from a set with b elements, to a set with a elements. There is only one function from the empty set to the empty set, so 0^(0) = 1, by definition.

If you are coming at it from the perspective of real analysis, then it only makes sense to define 0^(0) = 1 if we want the power series notation to look neat. 

In general, in any situation where the expression 0^(0) appears, the only useful value for it is 1, so when we need it to be defined, we define it to be 1.

There are two reasons why people sometimes like to keep 0^(0) undefined:

* in order to match *indeterminate limit forms* with *undefined expressions*, but that; and
* to be able to say that all elementary functions are continuous on their entire domains.

Honestly, the first of the above reasons is a bit silly because it's conflating limit forms and arithmetic expressions; those are two different concepts and should be treated as distinct.

The desire to have all elementary functions continuous over the entire domain is understandable, but it's generally more practical to have 0^(0) defined to equal 1, as discussed in the beginning of this post.


Edit: silly typo"
Why is 0^0 is 1?,"Well, why is 5^2 = 25? Of course we have to start by deciding x^y means something. The first meaning given to counting number exponents in school is repeated multiplication, i.e., x^n is the product of n copies of x. So, 5^2 = 5 \* 5 = 25. 

Does this give a meaning to 5^(0)? Kind of. 5^0 is the product of no numbers. Of course it doesn’t matter that 5 might have been the number you might multiply by if you weren’t not multiplying by any number, so x^0 = 5^(0) for every x.

We do choose to give “the product of no numbers” a meaning, since of course multiplication is a very general, very basic idea that is very useful in all areas of maths. Say it’s some number P = x^0 = 0! etc. What possible number could be the product of no numbers? If you think about it, if you start multiplying after not multiplying, then you can decide the number P should satisfy statements like P \* 2 = 2, etc. This is how we decide the number that is the product of no numbers is P = 1. 

Thinking 0^0 is undefined is a common misconception because 0^0 is an *indeterminate form*, which is a statement about limits in calculus: If you have two functions with limits f(x) → 0 and g(x) → 0, then it’s not possible to determine the limit of f(x)^g(x) without further information. It has nothing to do with doing arithmetic with the counting number zero."
Why is 0^0 is 1?,"Context matters. It is convenient when working with polynomials power series, then then you can write x^0 instead of having a special case for the constant term."
Why is 0^0 is 1?,"In short, it’s by convention. And we choose 1 because it makes some things easier. 

E.g. x^y is the number of ways you can pick y things for a set containing x items with replacement. How many ways can you take 0 things from a drawer with 0 items in it?  There’s one way, you take nothing.  

In algebra and programming it makes sense to be 1 so that we can use recursion. 

But in other “more advanced” contexts it can sometimes be undefined or indeterminate."
Why is 0^0 is 1?,As everyone else is saying its either the empty product or the number of functions from the empty set to itself which is obviously 1.
Why is 0^0 is 1?,"Defining 0^0 = 1 is useful in certain applications. 

Thats why."
Why is 0^0 is 1?,"4 means start with 0 and add 1, 4 times.  0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1

2\*3 means start with 1 and add 2 3 times.  0 + 2 + 2 + 2

2\^3 means start with 1 and then multiple by 2, 3 times so 1\*2\*2\*2

0\^0 means start with 1 and multiply by 0, 0 times.  so 1"
Why is 0^0 is 1?,"If you don't want to add anything, you just add 0.

If you don't want to multiply with anything, you just multiply with 1.

  
They are both the identities/neutral elements with regards to that operation. So if you do sums and you don't sum up anything (so you have that x exactly 0 times, or 0x), you get 0. If you multiply and you don't multiply anything (so you have x\^0), you get 1. And in both cases the value for x doesn't matter because they don't even appear anywhere."
Why is 0^0 is 1?,"In the context of elementary algebra or calculus, 0^0 is actually indeterminate, meaning it could amount to just about anything. 

Any other non-zero number ‘a’ raised to the power 0 does indeed equal 1.

This is because a^0 = a^(x - x) = a^x / a^x = 1. "
Why is 0^0 is 1?,"Its just part of the definition of exponentiation that anything to the power if 0 is 1.

It follows from:
x^y / x^y = x^y * x^(-y) = x^(y-y) = x^0
And
x^y / x^y = 1

Now strictly speaking, if you plugged in 0 for x you would get 0/0, which is technically undefined. And strictly speaking, 0^0 is therefore undefined. But also, it’s sort of 1, depending on how you define the operation."
Why is 0^0 is 1?,"The simplest answer is, it's just convenient to define it that way in some branches of mathematics.  The same expression is also sometimes treated as undefined.  It just depends on what's useful in a given context.

The ""explanations"" you see are also contextual.  It might be more accurate to call them ""justifications"", since they're really just tricks that illustrate a way of looking at what 0^(0) is actually describing."
Why is 0^0 is 1?,"0^0 is undefined.
Depending on context it might be useful to have it equal to 1 or 0.
For example the Taylor expansion for e^x and you have x=0, then the first term is 0^0 / 0!  + 0^1 / 1!  and so on, where all except the first term are equal to zero but since e^0 is 1 the first term must be one so in that sense 0^0 must be equal to one."
Why is 0^0 is 1?,"It is a simplification due to the concepts that you are learning at this moment. They are just continuing the pattern of the x^0. 
In an equation, if x is in the denominator, then the value can not equal 0. What you are doing is a weird thing because, when you have an exponent of less than one it is the root of 1/x (so 2^.5 would be equal to sqrt2 and 3^.333 would be the cubed root of 3) and the negative roots where you would have 1/x^value like 2^-2 would be equal to 1/2^2 or 1/4. 
In an equation if you have 1/x, you are going to have an undefined variable. So you put the equation as x != 0 (!= means not equal). So in your equation 0 != 0 (empty space)
0 is undefined."
Why is 0^0 is 1?,"Because without it a lot of theorems in math would be wrong, such as the binomial theorem.

A lot of formulas and computations implicitly assume that the empty product is 1, and that makes 0^0 equal to 1. This is also the reason why the IEEE standard requires 0^0 to be 1, because otherwise some widely used formulas would not be true."

For example, non zero real numbers raised to any exponent are always equal to the the same base number raised to the next higher exponent, divided by the base number. 

In the case of zero though, that would mean that 0 squared divided by 0 to the first power ought to equal 0 to the first power. But since zero squared is just zero, that's zero over zero, which isn't the same thing.

An easy way to justify it though is to take the limit of x^0 as x approaches 0. From both positive and negative values, the function approaches 1."

Why is 0^0 is 1?,"It's a bit weird, and mathematicians don't all agree on one single answer! Here's why:

1. **Reason it might be 1:**
   * You know how any number to the power of 0 is usually 1? Like 5\^0 = 1, and 100\^0 = 1. Following this pattern, it seems like 0\^0 *should* be 1.
   * In many parts of math, like when counting things or using certain formulas, it's super helpful to just *decide* that 0\^0 = 1. It makes the rules work nicely.
2. **Reason it might be tricky (or ""undefined""):**
   * Now think about zero raised to any *other* power: 0\^2 = 0 x 0 = 0, and 0\^5 = 0 x 0 x 0 x 0 x 0 = 0. Following *this* pattern, it seems like 0\^0 *should* be 0.
   * Uh oh! One pattern says the answer should be 1, and another says it should be 0. They clash!
   * Because of this clash, in some more advanced parts of math (like calculus, which you might learn about later), mathematicians say 0\^0 is ""undefined"" or ""indeterminate."" That's a fancy way of saying it doesn't have one single, clear answer in that situation.

**So, the simple answer is:**

* Often, especially in everyday math and formulas, people just **treat 0\^0 as being equal to 1** because it's useful.
* But sometimes, in more complicated math, it's seen as **tricky and doesn't have a single fixed value.**

How to find inverse of 10^x and e^x,"Your last lines are wrong: the expression ""g(f(2))"" is not multiplication, so you can't just divide by f(2) to get rid of it.

That said, I'm also not quite sure what you're asking. The inverses of exponential functions like e^(x) are called logarithms, written log(x). You can't ""derive"" that - it's more like a definition."
How to find inverse of 10^x and e^x,"To be honest, these are elementary enough functions that ""find"" the inverse is almost confusing or a trick question compared to ""define"" the inverse.

Can you tell me the inverse of x^2 (for x > 0)? If you said ""the square root of x"", then understand that this is literally the definition of the answer to the question. 

If I have a function f, what does the inverse *mean*? Informally it means that i can recover x from the result of f by applying the inverse. That is, if f(x) = y, inverse-f(y) = x.

So what is the inverse of x^2? Well, given a value y > 0, it finds x > 0 such that x*x = y. That is the definition of square root.

What is the inverse of e^x? Well, given a value y > 0, it finds x such that e^x = y. 

So what is the definition of the inverse of 10^x?

There just like ""square root"" is the name of the inverse of x^2, ""natural log"" is the name of the inverse of e^x, and ""log (base 10)"" is the name of the inverse of 10^x.

I doubt the problem you're working on wants you to reinvent the wheel and invent logarithmic and discover all their properties, but all their properties can be derived from those definitions! 

To avoid a potential pitfall , let me clarify that the only reason I say that the definition is basically the answer here is that these are sort of elementary building blocks of functions. They are a single application of a single operation and you cant really reduce or rexpress the answer with other elementary functions.

Sometimes you can derive inverses explicitly without inventing new notation. Like, the inverse of the function f(x) = 5x means a function that, given y, finds x such that 5x = y. So you can simplify to see that x = y/5. Viewed as a function of y, g(y) = y/5 can be considered the inverse of f.

And sometimes the function is slightly more complicated involving compositions of functions. It doesn't make sense to ""define"" the inverse of the function, f(x) = (x+1)^2 as its own thing. Instead, we can say that if (x+1)^2 = y, then x+1 = sqrt(y), so x = sqrt(y)-1. We could reuse the sqrt notation, so it was enough to express this."
How to find inverse of 10^x and e^x,"I don't see how you got from g(f(x)) = x to g = x/f(x)

More importantly, I don't really see what the aim of the question is. The answer is the logarithm, that's how the logarithm is *defined*. It's the inverse to an exponential function"

Now I’m working on a teaching cert for math after working in a school for several years including a fair amount of math work.  While I was teaching, I used the online curriculum provided as well as a lot of other online resources like Kutasoftware.com, ixl.com, Kahn academy, and YouTube videos in addition to just take time to practice the stuff.  I always hear about brilliant.org but haven’t tried it so I can’t speak to that one.  I also designed some projects where students had to use the skills to solve real problems which helped.  I have to say that I’m curious what other people have to add.  

One thing I can say that will help is to make a genuine effort to start seeing math in your everyday life and think about how it can apply.  Start getting curious about things and then try to find answers.  

This seems silly but I started getting more interested in flat earth videos and thinking “how can people possibly believe this stuff” and wanting to better understand the proofs of how we know the earth is a globe.  Tons of trig involved in that."
Is it possible to do this without a calculator?,Not really. Those would usually be your final answer as plugging them into a calculator would give you an approximation instead of the true value.
Is it possible to do this without a calculator?,Are you allowed a protractor and ruler?
Is it possible to do this without a calculator?,"To how much precision? You may be able to do a decent approximation of each, but generally it's just not possible to compute trig ratios or their inverses except for the handful of ""nice"" ones that you probably already know, and a few others if you also get tricky with identities like half angle and angle sum/difference that you may *not* know."
Is it possible to do this without a calculator?,"You generally cannot find the precise numerical answers for arcsec(1.72), arctan(8.7), or arccot(-0.8) using just a standard unit circle without a calculator, because the unit circle only provides exact sine and cosine values (and thus exact tan, cot, sec, csc) for specific common angles like 30°, 45°, 60°, etc. The numbers 1.72, 8.7, and -0.8 are not among these special output values that correspond directly to those common angles; for instance, arcsec(1.72) requires finding an angle where cosine is 1/1.72, which isn’t a simple fraction like 1/2 or √2/2 found on the circle. You can use the unit circle to estimate the quadrant or approximate range for these angles (like knowing arctan(8.7) must be close to 90° since tangent is large and positive), but you can’t get the exact decimal value, meaning that actual test questions without a calculator would likely have to do with inverse trig functions of values directly derivable from the unit circle, such as arcsec(2) or arctan(1)."
Is it possible to do this without a calculator?,No. Well not in a reasonable amount of time at least

"I used to hate math, but now I genuinely want to learn it — especially for Quantitative Finance. Where should I start?","Hi! Congrats on a new desire to learn math!

I would say that algebra is the foundation for this. Learn algebra and the fundamental behaviors.

Especially with more complicated math, it’s the algebra that gets you."
"I used to hate math, but now I genuinely want to learn it — especially for Quantitative Finance. Where should I start?","Start with the basics: calculus, linear algebra, probability, and statistics. These are the core of quantitative finance. Once you have a grasp on these, move to more advanced topics like stochastic processes, optimization, and financial modeling. You’ll need Python or C++ for implementation.

Resources:

Khan Academy for the basics.

QuantStart and Paul Wilmott's books for the finance side.

MIT OpenCourseWare for more in-depth courses.

Statistical Learning by Hastie and Tibshirani for machine learning aspects.

You can’t skip steps. Be methodical. This will take time."
"I used to hate math, but now I genuinely want to learn it — especially for Quantitative Finance. Where should I start?","To even dip your toes into the math of quantitative finance you need a very good grasp on calculus and analysis (including measure theory and linear algebra,), probability and statistics, and some microeconomics and finance. Depending on your current background this may take you between half a year and three or four years to learn to an adequate level.

If you are starting from 0, learn algebra and trigonometry (""precalculus;"" I used OpenStax's free textbook) and then single-variable calculus (I used Stewart's and Thomas'). Then learn linear algebra (I used Larson's, but it's not very rigorous). Then learn multivariable calculus (same books), analysis, and probability.

Truth is many quantitative finance programs require math knowledge equivalent to a BSc degree in a quantitative discipline like math or physics or engineering. It's a lot. I am doing my degree in applied math because I once had interest in becoming a quant (it's not out of the picture for me). Unless you have a lot of discipline the best way would be to go to college for it."
Does anyone get confused with CDF AND PDF,"Some people in the world probably get it confused.

I personally do not because I teach the subject lol"
Does anyone get confused with CDF AND PDF,"Can you explain more?  With or without calculus?

PDF and CDF are different ways of representing (and using) the same distribution.  In a PDF the area under the curve will be 1 and represents the probability density  ""at that position"" of getting the value. In a CDF the value of the curve zero at the left (lowest part of the domain) and 1 at the right, and the probability is, well, continuous.

If you drop the density (continuous) part and make it discrete, could you imagine the cumulative probability and point probability for rolling a d6?  What if you pick a continuous random variable between 0 and 1? What about 0 to 2?"
Does anyone get confused with CDF AND PDF,"The “C” stands for cumulative, so it’s the total sum of probabilities up to a certain value. It starts at 0 and goes up to 1 without decreasing. That’s how I think about it. PDF is the other one."
How would something like tan(150) become negative 1 over sqr root 3,https://preview.redd.it/qjildsb8xtte1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a00a7949f197b157d0e3b9351ea6f770a3754312
How would something like tan(150) become negative 1 over sqr root 3,"Do you know what the sine and cosine are of 30 degrees, 45 degrees, and 60 degrees? Those special angles are where the square roots come from.

For instance:

>I’ve also seen csc(45) but the answer would be square root 2.

If you draw a 45-45-90 triangle, the two legs are equal (two equal angles means you have an isosceles triangle so you also have two equal legs).

If those legs are of length 1, then the hypotenuse is given by 1\^2 + 1\^2 = c\^2, so c\^2 = 2 or c = sqrt(2).

The sine of 45 is opposite over hypotenuse = 1/sqrt(2).

The csc of 45 is the reciprocal, so sqrt(2)/1 or just sqrt(2).

You are supposed to memorize these special angles and their sines and cosines."
How would something like tan(150) become negative 1 over sqr root 3,"Do you mean ""tan(150)"" or ""tan(150°)""?
***
Assuming the latter -- do you know the exact values for ""sin(30°); cos(30°)""? If not:

* Draw an equilateral triangle. By symmetry, each interior angle equals 60°
* Draw a mirror axis through one corner, and the center of the opposing side

You will get two right 30-60-90 triangles, and you can find the missing leg via Pythagoras. With all sides at hand, find ""sin(30°); cos(30°)"". Can you take it from here?"
How would something like tan(150) become negative 1 over sqr root 3,"tan(150)  = sin(150)/cos(150) 

sin(150) = sin(180-150) = sin(30)  <--- Identity sin(x) = sin (180 - x) 

cos(150) = -cos(180-150) = -cos(30) <--- Identity cos(x) = -cos(180 - x)

Hence

tan(150) = sin(150)/cos(150) = sin(30)/(-cos(30))

sin 30 = 1/2

cos 30 = sqrt(3)/2 

Hence... tan(150) = (1/2) / (-sqrt(3)/2) = - 1/sqrt(3)

Anyway you need to expect a negative value because sin is positive between 0 and 180 and cos is negative between 90 and 270. So tan is positive from 0 to 90, negative from 90 to 180 and positive from 180 to 270."
How would something like tan(150) become negative 1 over sqr root 3,"Sin(150) = 1/2
Cos(150) = sqrt(3)/2

Sin(150)/cos(150) = (1/2) / (sqrt(3)/2)

Per algebra, (1/2) / (sqrt(3)/2) = (1/2) * (2/(sqrt(3)/2))

Then the 2’s cancel out.


Thus, Sin(150)/cos(150) = 1/sqrt(3)"
How would something like tan(150) become negative 1 over sqr root 3,"I always believed that it was a result of graphs, whenever someone calculated tan waves and sine waves and stuff,  the result for tan(150) would be negative. Another way to visualize this is by drawing a cartesian plane and representing points through co-ordinates and vectors. One would see that if one made an angle from positive x-axis to 150, then the points derived will be negative. Because it is in II Quad, x-coord is -ve and y-cord is +ve, making sure that their quotient is negative. 

Thats why in angles between 180 and 270, tan() is actually positive again"
How would something like tan(150) become negative 1 over sqr root 3,"You need to remember two special triangles, as another poster pointed out:
* a bisected equilateral triangle, and
* an isosceles right triangle

Apply the theorem of Pythagoras on each of these triangles, and you’ll see where the ratios come from (hint: without loss of generality, one could fix one of the sides to be of unit length — the hypotenuse is the usual choice).

Next, depending on how far along you are in your trigonometry class, you’ll need to apply the summation formulae (150 degrees is 90 + 60 or 180 - 30) for the standard sin, cos and tan functions. 

Alternatively, if you’ve already covered coordinate geometry, then extend the trig functions to other quadrants by means of the unit circle to get the various combinations of positive and negative signs. "

A straight line with end points **u** and **v** and parameter s is given by

How was your experience studying Real Analysis?,">Did you have a good foundation in Calculus beforehand, or did you have to study both at the same time due to lack of preparation?

Neither of those two options.

How was your experience studying Real Analysis?,"Well, this is my experience both as an instructor and a student in the USA.

At an elite school they can just throw you into real analysis and it’s sink or swim (most sink).

Anyway good luck!"
How was your experience studying Real Analysis?,"I had a great experience with it. My professor was teaching it for the first time, and wrote a book to go along with it that the class collectively helped edit for extra credit. The entire text as it was being written was put online to access at any point throughout the semester. Every class started with a fun math related fact or problem. I was more prepared for that final than I was in any other class through college. I got 99/100 +38 extra credit points. (I got the most extra credit by a lot because of how much work I did to edit the textbook, not everyone scored so highly so easily)"

How was your experience studying Real Analysis?,"In the US, I took calculus 1 through 3, then took proofs and linear algebra, then took real analysis (technically only proofs and calc 2 were required for real analysis). At first, I didn't like it. I didn't understand the whole epsilon/delta stuff or how any of it worked. I didn't really understand what the epsilon and delta even meant. I complete understand that pain you're feeling now. However, I had a complete 180 when I took my second semester of it, where my instructor emphasized how awesome some of the unexpected results are. Like, yes every differentiable function is continuous, but every derivative *is not* continuous! That's crazy! Stuff like that is really cool. Then in grad school, I took measure theory and general topology. I really liked both of them, but I didn't like how measure theory felt so focused on only one measure (the Lebesgue measure) when there's so much theory about general measures, but I also struggled with how some topologies don't provide much to work with. Fractal geometry became a nice mix of both that scratched all the itches I had, while still being deep into analysis. I still get into all sorts of crazy unexpected results, mess around with epsilon/delta stuff, consider sweeping generalizations, etc. It's very fun now!"

I’d recommend learning from multiple textbooks, and try to construct proofs yourself without help as much as possible.

My recommendation for textbook would be Take a look at Terrence Tao’s Analysis 1 book. He starts from ground-0 and in my opinion the structure and exercises if done honestly and diligently will give you a solid understanding and foundation in Analysis and constructing proofs.

How was your experience studying Real Analysis?,"I'm Irish. I did Higher-Level Mathemamatics in secondary school. I did Honours Mathematics in university.

At the time, the usual material from Calculus I and II was contained in the Higher-Level school syllabus. We also covered vectors, matrices, and linear transformations, but only in the (2×2) case (not enough for a proper treatment of vector calculus).

In my 1st year at university, Honours Mathematics was split into an Analysis part and an Algebra part. Both parts ran over two semesters and were focused on proofs over computations. Students who couldn't keep up were advised to switch to the lower level Mathematical Studies programme.

The Analysis part covered all of the standard material in single variable analysis. The algebra required for multivariable analysis was developed in the Algebra part.

I studied multivariable calculus from an old copy of Thomas & Finney between 1st and 2nd year. In 2nd year, we had Multivariable Analysis and Complex Analysis. I was also the TA for both of these modules for several years while I was a graduate student."

I bristled at that. ""Of course I have,"" I responded, and listed all the math courses I had to take to get my physics education (which included calculus, especially vector calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, etc).

""You've never had a math course,"" he responded. ""You should take my Analysis course at the night school."" Our organization was affiliated with a university, and we could take free courses from the university that were taught on our campus.

"apparently this can be solved using ""uniform"", how?","Okay, so your way of calculating the average boxes needed, adding up 40/40 + 40/39 all the way to 40/1, is exactly right for this problem, usually called the Coupon Collector’s problem. The word “uniform” is just talking about the basic assumption that each distinct item has an equal chance of being in any box you open; it’s not a different calculation method, it’s just why your method works. To get that sum faster when you have a really large number of items, say thousands instead of just 40, you can use a good approximation. Multiply the number of items n by the natural logarithm of n plus about 0.577 (which is a constant called gamma, γ). So the estimate is n * (ln(n) + γ). For 40 items though, your direct sum is perfectly fine and gives the precise answer."
"apparently this can be solved using ""uniform"", how?","It’s N\*H_N, where H_N is the Nth harmonic number.

There are various methods for calculating/approximating the harmonic numbers, some of which are mentioned on the Wikipedia page.

For example if gamma is Euler’s constant (about 0.57721) then we have the bounds ln n + gamma < H_n < ln (n+1) +gamma.

The harmonic series is also a pretty well-known series so you can find tools online for calculating it."

The LHS of your expected value is correct. More generally it is x * H_x where H_x is the x’th harmonic number.

Can someone explain how these histograms have the same mean? (picture in comment),"If you're sure they do have the same mean, it's because the localized imbalance you see in some places is cancelled by an opposite localized imbalance everywhere.

"[Limits] I'm having trouble understanding the continuous function theorem, can anyone dumb it down for me please?","What are you actually trying to do? Is there a problem statement? You just wrote down pieces of the example. 

You don't ""use"" f. The theorem needs four things: 

1. a\_n are real
2. a\_n -> L
3. f is defined at all a\_n
4. f is continuous at L 

Check each of those things *separately*. Then you get to say that f(a\_n) -> f(L). What you do with that depends on your goal. 

I'm assuming it just asks ""what's lim f(a\_n)?"". You literally just write what the theorem says:

>lim f(a\_n) = f(1)

[High School Math] 3D Geometry,"It will definitely help if you sketch a diagram. It’s basically saying a sphere is embedded snugly inside a cube — that’s what the term ‘inscribed’ means. 

So the sphere touches the centre of each of the 6 faces of the cube. Consequently, the distance from the centre of any one face to the centre of the opposite face is the diameter of the sphere, which also happens to equal the side length of the cube, which is 10 units. 

Now, if we go from one vertex to the diagonally opposite vertex, the length of this diagonal can be found using the 3-D distance formula. Let’s place one vertex at an arbitrary location (x, y, z), and without loss of generality, let’s say the other vertex is at (x + 10, y + 10, z + 10). Then, using the distance formula, we find that the diagonal connecting the vertices is sqrt(300) = 10 sqrt(3) units long. 

Now, part of this span between the diagonally opposite vertices overlaps with the diameter of the sphere near the centre of both geometric objects. So if we subtract out the diameter from the total diagonal length, we get the total length of the two pieces of the diagonal that fall outside the sphere. This difference is 10 sqrt(3) - 10. 

By symmetry, the distance between one vertex and the surface of the sphere is exactly half of this value, so we get 5 sqrt(3) - 5 for the final answer. "

Equilibrium trig question,"Your calculation is correct for finding an internal angle of that triangle, specifically the angle opposite the side representing F2 (length 80). Since the forces are in equilibrium, they form a closed triangle when placed head to tail (F1 + F2 + F3 = 0, or rearranged, F1 + F3 = -F2). The triangle you used effectively has sides 40, 70, and 80, and you correctly found the angle opposite the side of length 80 to be θ_triangle = arccos[(40² + 70² - 80²) / (2 * 40 * 70)] ≈ 88.97°. 

The issue is that this 88.97° angle represents the angle inside the vector triangle vertex where the vectors representing F1 and F3 would meet if placed head-to-tail. The question asks for the angle between F1 and F3 when they are acting on the point (tails together). This angle corresponds to the exterior angle of the triangle at that same vertex, which is supplementary to the internal angle. Therefore, the angle between the forces F1 and F3 as they act on the point is 180° - 88.97° ≈ 91.03°."

The globe measures latitude from the equator: 90°N is the north pole, and 90°S is the south pole. If you started at the intersection of the equator and the prime meridian, and kept going north to the pole, and then kept going, you're actually moving southward along the international date line. So you only need −90° to 90° of latitude to cover the globe. The spherical coordinate ϕ is measured from the north pole, but it's still a kind of latitude (technically, colatitude).

Now, if you take a third set where you keep everything the same as before but let theta range from 0 to 2pi, when we sweep the half-moon across one full rotation we get a ball (a sphere as well as all the points in its hollow inside) like the moon or the earth.

Why do integrals work?,"For a bit of intuition in formulas (no proof): think about what the integral of f from x to x+h is for small values of h.

Why do integrals work?,"An integral is essentially a measure of accumulation. If you are trying to measure what was accumulated over an interval, it stands to reason that you would take the total accumulation and subtract what had already been accumulated before the interval.

Why do integrals work?,"I struggled with this too until I found this explanation:

Imagine we want to find the area under the curve of a function f(x) between two bounds a and b. 

Area of a rectangle is base times height. If we want to find the area under a curve, we can imagine what the base times height would be if we “stretched” the curved part to fit a rectangle. Base would just be change in x, and height would be the average height of the function. So area under the curve is Δx*(average height)

We know Δx = b - a since the bounds are given to us. So how do we find the average height?

When we take the anti-derivative of f(x), we find a function F(x). If we think about how f(x) is related to F(x) we will realize that f(x) represents the slope of F(x) at any given point. Therefore, the average height of f(x) is the average slope of F(x) between the bounds.

So how do we find the average slope? This just is algebra! We take (F(b)-F(a))/Δx. Therefore, the average height of f(x) is (F(b)-F(a))/Δx.

Now we have everything we need. We have base  Δx, and we have height (F(b)-F(a))/Δx. Base times height works out to be F(b)-F(a), which is exactly the definite integral!"
Why do integrals work?,"Basic, basic answer is to look at the units.

THE QUESTION
It works because an anti derivative is the integral fucntion, just as an artifact set back by some constant displacement, we subtract both accumulators at two points so it gives an accumulation of only the difference from where we start and stopped it.


the antiderivative calculates the functions integral, it just starts at some unknown point c, and your given end point a.

But subing.   C to a - c to b.  Gives the difference region of any part of the fucntion"
Why do integrals work?,"It's called \*fundamental\* theorem of calculus (well, a part of it, the other part is probably even more important) for a reason. IIRC the demonstration is not even \*too\* complex, essentially you do the brunt of the work on the Riemann sum and then push it (not quite the rigorous term) with a limit into the definite integral."
Why do integrals work?,"The proof is in all calculus books:

Slice the area under the curve into rectangles of fixed height that touch the function, add them all together into a sum, take the limit of the sum as the width of the rectangles goes to zero and you get the result.

It’s just one of those mind boggling results in math"
Why do integrals work?,"This is usually proven in an analysis textbook, usually the last third of the book in a section called Integration or The Riemann Integral.

Why do integrals work?,"Reimann’s sum, where the width of the rectangle is infinitely small (delta x → dx)"
Why do integrals work?,You can find how Newton proved it in several textbooks including Stewart and Anton. It's a very accessible proof!
Why do integrals work?,"First, consider the integral to be a summation, that is what it actually is, a summation of steps (the integral is just fancy fluff). 

Consider, for a function f, and a step size 'e' take (f(0+e) - f(0))/0+e-0. That is, you find the tangent at each point. Now for each step n, let the input values be ((n-1)e) and (ne).

So what you're doing is simply adding the value for each slice of the derivative of the function, and what you've achieved is the volume of the derivative between two points.

So,suppose that instead, you want to know the volume of your function f, then if we could consider f to be the derivative of some function F, then what we would find is the volume of the function f, if we were to follow that summation. 

If you then take F(3)-F(2) you'd remove the volume that F(2) has from F(3). That is, the summation of the steps between  f(0) to f(2). 

Hopefully that makes sense, this was written on phone in bed, so might've missed a few words here and there.

The first part is more refined in calculus, where you want to find the limit, which is honestly a pretty weird concept... as you're not actually adding an infinite number of an analytic solutions of the difference that hold for each point, but you also kinda do."

Why do integrals work?,"I'm new to the concepts of integrals and derivatives and I'm in my first year of college, so I would like someone with more experience to evaluate my answer.

When they put the two numbers on the right side of the integral, I think they want the approximate area within that range. Therefore, subtraction takes the value from that range and then divides it into smaller parts. These smaller pieces increase the accuracy of the area they want to calculate. When we calculate the area of ​​these smaller pieces, we assume that all the values ​​within the x-axis range of that piece have the same value."
Why do integrals work?,"You should also know that sometimes the integral doesn't work. That's for the same reasons that sometimes a limit does not exist.

There are integrals that have +∞ as their value, and that is ok. There are integrals that have -∞ as a value and that is also ok.

But sometimes even assuming that the integral has a value (±∞ or a finite real number), can lead to a contradiction. And then we just have to accept that this integral does not exist.

In statistics, this can come up with some random variable and if you want to calculate its expected value."
Why do integrals work?,"dA = ydx

dA/dx = y"
Why do integrals work?,"Generally, you start with approximations and learn about limits. The limits take you to the point that the approximation uses infinitely small steps and gives you a more exact answer than you can get will discrete steps. It is not too difficult but not simplistic either.

The area under the curve is the cumulative result of all the 'steps' of the function. For example, as an object falls, its speed is the accumulation of how fast it has been traveling under acceleration (gravity). So, at any time, it is picking up speed based on everything that has happened since it was dropped. Thatxs the total area under the curve from time 0, or whatever. That may be an easy example to test.

Have you studied calculus at all? I'm not being insulting. I just don't know if you have a background or not and I take your question seriously."
Why do integrals work?,"For a more heuristic idea. Lets say F(x) gives you the area under a curve. Then think about what happens if you change the area a bit. 

Lets say you have the area up to point ""x"", given by F(x). If you add a little bit of area, going a little bit more to the right under the curve to x+d, F(x+d) must change by exacty that small amount of difference of area. This little bit of change should be pretty much exactly the height of the function at that point, so F(x+d)-F(x)\~f(x+d)

You should know that the local change of a function is exactly the derivative. So the derivative of F(x+d) at that point must be f(x+d). Thats the intuitive reason why the area function is connected via the derivative."
Why do integrals work?,Because the area under a graph increases at a rate equal to the height of the graph at that point.
Why do integrals work?,"An integral (there are several) is simply a sum of many small parts. That is what the integral sign means, sum. 

Considering the Rieman integral, it is the sum of rectangles with an equal width *dx*, and of varying heights *f(x)*. This is then literally a representation of the area under the graph of *f(x)*. Add in the limit of *dx -> 0* and you have the formal definition, and the integral now being the exact area under the curve.

The antiderivative is just another name for the integral iff it exists. In the way the derivative of *f* holds information about the slope of *f* at any point *x*, the antiderivative *F* of *f* holds information about a form of cummulative area under the curve from *0* up to a certain point *x*.     

An example:     
Consider *f(x) = 1* and *F(x) = x*.

How does the area under the curve of *f* change as you go towards *+inf*?

What about for *f(x) = x* and *F(x) = 1/2 x^2*.      

Can you see how *F(x) is the formula for the area of a triangle with baseline *x* and height *x*?"
Why do integrals work?,"Plot a function chart. 


Split the area under the function into multiple ""very thin"" vertical slices of the same width, let's call it dx.


Notice that these thin vertical slices are ""almost"" rectangles. Their width is dx (like mentioned before). Their height is ""approximately"" f(x).


So the area of a single ""almost rectangular"" slice is its height multiplied by its width, or f(x) * dx. Now you just need to add up the areas of all different rectangles. That would be the sum of f(x) * dx, for all the relevant values of x.


That's basically your integral. Except you'd want to calculate it precisely, and not ""approximately"", so you need to make dx ""infinitely small"".


Now there are of course strict mathematical definitions for all of this. But if you're an engineer or any kind of applied scientist, you learn the definitions once, pass an exam, and then happily forget them."
Why do integrals work?,antiderivatives F are basically just the area under the curve plus a constant which gets cancelled out when subtracting the 2

There are different techniques to develop a better understanding of key mathematical concepts. You could start with an intuitive and informal explanation or example, but ultimately it’s also better to get a firmer grounding in limits (for calculus and analysis specifically), and in the formal methods of writing proofs. "
Why do integrals work?,Because limits work!! 
-3 < x < 2,"When you square the interval -3 < x < 2, you're not just squaring the endpoints. You're squaring every number in between. The function x^2 reaches its minimum at x = 0, which lies inside the interval, and x^2 = 0 there. So the smallest squared value is 0, not 4. The largest is at x = -3 (or x = 3, if it were included), which gives 9. So the new range is 0 < x^2 < 9."
-3 < x < 2,"Graph the square function on the (-3,2) domain, and then draw the function's image on the y-axis.

The actual reason is that at one point you multiply by a number that can be positive or negative, so you have to separate the original relation as (0<=x<2 OR -3<x<=0), which gives (0<= x^2 <4 OR 0<=x^2 <9).  The order's changed in the second one because you've multiplied by a non-positive number."
-3 < x < 2,Where does your 4 come from
-3 < x < 2,"1 is in between -3 and 2, but 1^2 = 1 is not included in 4 < x < 9.

Also, since 0 is also in between -3 and 2 and 0^2 = 0, it should actually be 0 **<=** x < 9."
-3 < x < 2,Ask yourself what happens when you square numbers between -3 and 0. Those squares are now between 0 and 9. Now do the same for the numbers between 0 and 2. Those squares live between 0 and 4. So all of the squares we have looked at are between 0 and 4 and between 0 and 9. Putting it all together the interval from 0 to 9 encompasses all the possible squares
-3 < x < 2,"You have to think things through a little more carefully when squaring inequalities.

Starting at x just above -3, you have values for x\^2 that are close to (but less than) 9. As x goes from -3 to 0, the squares go DOWN from 9. The lowest value a square can have is 0, and since 0 is between -3 and 2, then x\^2 does get to 0.

So you're going to have x >= 0.

Now x goes past 0 and heads toward 2. The value of x\^2 increases from 0 toward 4 (not reaching 4).

So we see that over that interval, x\^2 does get arbitrarily close to 9 due to x getting close to -3. But it doesn't reach 9. But x\^2 does reach 0.

So 0 <= x\^2 < 9."
-3 < x < 2,When you multiply inequality by a number the result will depend on a sign of that number. If it’s negative the “arrows” fill flip. Example: 2>x>1 multiply by -2 -4<-2x<-2 . So in your case you actually need to square on two different intervals to get a final result. From -3 to 0 and from 0 to 2. 
-3 < x < 2,"> we square -3 < x < 2 it become 0 < x < 9

I would say that squaring `-3 < x < 2` gives `0 ≤ x² < 9`, with an `x²` in the middle (not `x`) and with `0 ≤` rather than `0 <`. Depending on the context, you might use `x` for everything. You might also see this with interval notation: squaring numbers in `(-3, 2)` gives you numbers in `[0, 9)`.

Now, why? 

1. Pick a number between -3 and 2. 
2. Square that number and write down the result.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2, this time picking decimal that is not a whole number.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 a few more times, trying to include some crazier numbers like (-1.83)² = 3.3489.
3. Notice that 0 is between -3 and 2. If you haven't used it already, be sure to include 0² = 0 in your list of results. In a very very general sense, it's often good to look at what happens with x = -1, x = 0, and x = 1 because sometimes those numbers behave very differently than other numbers.
4. Look at all the squared results you got. Are any of them less than 0? Are any of them more than 9? Crucially, *did you get any result less than 4*? If you did >!(and you should ahve, with both 0 and something like 3.3489)!<, then ""4 < result < 9"" cannot be correct since some of your results are not greater than 4."
-3 < x < 2,"Go on desmos and type in: `y=x^{2} {-3<x<2}`

Note that the domain of x is restricted to the bounds set, -3 to 2.

What is the range after this domain restriction is applied?"

Does anyone know how to solve these two problems?,"For the first one, we have x^ (x^ (sqrt(5))) = sqrt(5).

Let y = x ^ sqrt(5).

We then have sqrt(5) = x^y .

Note that the previous two equations are the same if y = sqrt(5).

Then the required expression is y^(-2) = 1/5.

For the second one, we can use the same trick to show that x = (5)^(1/5). 

If we let y = x^ (x^x), the part inside the x^x root of the expression can be simplified to y, so A = x."

Why do normal distributions have the values they have?,"> no idea why the probability of getting a value within 1 standard deviation is 68.27% chance.

That's like asking why pi is 3.14... It really follows from the definition and there is no ""why"".

A better question would be where the normal distribution comes from. And for that question there is an answer:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem

(This is btw what you would probably call a ""deeper meaning"")"
Why do normal distributions have the values they have?,"Yes, this is indeed self-referential. Normal distributions have the values they have, because the values they have belong to the distribution we call ""the normal distribution"". All definitions work this way! 

Why are normal distributions important? Because *a lot of things follow the normal distribution*. The normal distribution is by far the most common distribution used.

A big reason for this is the Central Limit Theorem. Take any large sample from a population. Take the average of that sample, to recieve a new random variable we call ""the sample mean"". The sample mean is normally distributed, even if each member of the population is not. 

In statistics, we care a lot about understanding a population through sampling. We can apply what we know about normal distributions to any sample we want."
Why do normal distributions have the values they have?,"Why do you think it’s self referential? To find the probability of getting a value within 1 SD, you integrate the PDF over the region within 1 SD of the mean, and this gives you 68.27%."
Why do normal distributions have the values they have?,"The normal distribution has a well defined formula for its pdf. 

Accordingly probabilities are defined by integrating over the appropriate bounds. Now we run into two problems: 1) calculus is not required for intro stats and 2) the antiderivative is not elementary so we use technology or tables.

You can transform any normal distribution to the standard normal to allow us to use said tables."
Why do normal distributions have the values they have?,"It’s the area beneath the function f(z) = (2pi)^-0.5 * exp(-0.5*z^2 ), above the x axis, to the right of -1, and to the left of 1."
Why do normal distributions have the values they have?,That’s just the definition of probability my friend
Why do normal distributions have the values they have?,"The different distributions are generated by different processes. The binomial occurs when many processes add up, each process having a more or less equal chance of taking one of two states. If you've ever seen the demonstration where many plinko chips are allowed to collect at the base of a Plinko board, you've seen it in action.

As the number of binary processes approach infinity, the binomial curve smooths out to form a normal distribution. The reason that the normal curve is so ""normal"" is that a lot of the processes in nature involve the stacking up of many (!) approximately binomial processes. Why the probabilities are what they are involves the calculus of the areas under a curve formed by such a process."
Why do normal distributions have the values they have?,"Gaussian distribution comes from a simple mechanism that shows up a lot of nature. Flip a box of pennies and graph how many heads there in a histogram. Take the limit of an infinite number of pennies an infinite number of times. Normalize the area under the curve to be 1. That curve has an equation.

Find what width a standard deviation is. Integrate the area from -1 to +1 standard deviation (or 0 to +1 or -2 to +2) and you get very specific numbers.

These numbers are inescapable consequences of the box of pennies (and a lot more) mechanism. The Gaussian just has that mathematical character just like pi or the internal angle or a regular pentagon."
Why do normal distributions have the values they have?,"A normal distribution is e^-x^(2) - with a few constants added on to recenter, rescale, and make sure its probabilities add up to 1.

Why that equation? Because it's a convergent fixed point under addition. Add together two distributions of this type and you'll get another normal distribution. Add together two distributions that aren't normal but are sufficiently sane - like rolling two d6's - and you'll get something closer to a normal distribution than you started with.  Try to prove it if you like.

From that, variance and standard deviation are defined.  The variance is the average of the squares of the differences (from the mean to each data point).  The mean/average is the point that gives the smallest such value aka the least squares - in this way the average, normal distribution, and least-squared technique from linear algebra all converge.  To correct the units, you take the square root and get the standard deviation.  These are intrinsically meaningful values.

When you work out what those constants actually are for a given mean and standard deviation such that the area under the probability density function is 1, it comes out to the equation you're used to.  𝜋 is involved!  The 68% falls out of the math after you take the integral, but there is no elementary formula for that integral.

People commonly assume that normal distributions are ubiquitous or that ever distribution is normal, but it's important to remember that we started with adding distributions. If you were instead multiplying them you'd get a different result."
Why do normal distributions have the values they have?,It's the area under the well-defined Z-curve between Z=-1 and Z=+1. What is unclear to you?

That's the only answer you should ever need."

Is a(b+c) one term or two terms?,"It's a term, which is a product of two factors, the second of which is made up of two terms. ""Terms"" are separated by plus and minus signs, whereas ""factors"" are separated by multiply and divide signs.

I'm afraid I don't agree with what you say about 20/5(2+2), though. Whether or not 5(2+2) is a single term has no impact on whether you do the multiplication or the division first."
Is a(b+c) one term or two terms?,"The problem here is the lack of a vinculum. That would remove the ambiguity. The way it's written now, the ambiguity is the point. 

If I were given this expression, I'd send it back. If I were required to evaluate it, then I would treat 5(2+2) as the denominator because the alternative is sloppy af. 

After all, when someone writes 1/xy, they usually mean the reciprocal of xy. If they had intended for it to be y times the reciprocal of x, then they would've written it as (1/x)y or, better yet, simply y/x. 

So if I had to evaluate 20/5(2+2), I have to assume they don't mean 20(2+2)/5 because that's a dumb way to present it. And if they tell me that they intended for 20/5(2+2) is indeed 16, then I'll accept that was their intent, but I'll also tell them their notation sucks."

If your just calculating stuff for yourself the important thing is that you are able to understand what you wrote. If someone else is going to read it the important part is that they understand it.

Is a(b+c) one term or two terms?,"It's one term, consisting of two factors that in turn consist of one and two terms, respectively.

However, that definition has absolutely no connection to your expression. Rather, the expression displays the cruel realities of inline infix notation: you simply cannot express mixed division and multiplication without liberal use of parentheses to dispel ambiguities that arise if you try.

While expressions of the type a/bc play somewhat nicely in algebra, this only works because algebra considers the juxtaposition between b and c to have special precedence over both multiplikation and division. This makes it easy to write polynomials with as little parentheses as possible but causes mayhem with order of operations.

Once you consider expressions of the type a/b(c), all bets are off and the author of such monstrosities deserves a swift smack on the fingers and a stern look from the teacher that sees it."
Is a(b+c) one term or two terms?,"Just because a(b+c) on its own is one term doesn't mean d/a(b+c) means d/(a(b+c)). There is generally no concept of ""terms"" within a product.

A term is just something that is not a sum. If the top-level operation is not addition or subtraction, then it's a single term.

a(b+c) is one term on its own, but in d/a(b+c), it is not. Then d/a(b+c) is the term."
Is a(b+c) one term or two terms?,"I depends on how you define ""term"". In first order logic terms are defined as variables, constants and n-ary functions with n existing terms in.  Let M and A denote multiplication and addition, then a(b+c) would be written as

M(a,A(b,c))

which is clearly one term since M is a 2-ary function with 2 terms inside. But therein lies the ambiguity and why the answer to your question does not quell the problem. It's one term that is a combination of two terms. a(b+c) is one term, but both a and (b+c) are different terms aswell."
Is a(b+c) one term or two terms?,"I think the issue here is arithmetic vs. algebra. Arithmetic has a pretty strict order of operations and has a clear answer of 16. Algebra, however, likes shortcuts. Sometimes, those shortcuts can be weird when observed through the lens of the order of operations. Parentheses are used to denote when something should be done first. However, in algebra, there are shortcuts that imply parentheses but don't actually construct them.

You can argue that the shortcuts are flawed notations due to ambiguity and conflict with clear orders of operation. Or you can argue that the shortcuts are merely well-known meta style notations that prove to be useful in the amount of time saved by not having to write additional parentheses.

Ideally, you'll know your audience. If you are writing the problem for a person or people who understand shortcuts, then shortcuts wouldn't cause any confusion and they can be useful. If you are writing the problem for a person or people who don't understand shortcuts, or people who have unknown identities, then it may pay to more heavily scrutinize your notations to be as clear as possible."

"Why is (100) 33% greater than (75), but (75) is 25% less than (100)?","Because you're using a different reference for each calculation.

"Why is (100) 33% greater than (75), but (75) is 25% less than (100)?","75 is 3/4 of 100. So therefore 75 is 25% less than 100.  
25 is 1/3 of 75. So therefore 75+25 = 100.

You're comparing two different numbers.

 25 is a bigger slice of 75 than it is of 100.

That's why 25=33% of 75 and yet 25 = 25% of 100.

Two different numbers you're comparing against."
"Why is (100) 33% greater than (75), but (75) is 25% less than (100)?","The way I've always thought about it:

75 is 3/4 (i.e. 1 - 1/4) of 100. To go the other way, you take the reciprocal of the fraction: 100 is 4/3 (i.e. 1 + 1/3) of 75"

"Why is (100) 33% greater than (75), but (75) is 25% less than (100)?","It's a problem of ratios.


5 to 4 is the same as 1.25 to 1, so 5 is 125% of 4.


But turn it around: 4 to 5 is the same as .8 to 1, i.e. 4 is 80% of 5, or 20% smaller.


But talking about % smaller or larger obscures the original ratios, as it leads you to subtract 100%.  Without that transform the numbers form a clear pattern: the two percentages, when viewed as multiples of the original number - e.g. 80% and 125% in my example - are reciprocals of each other.  Which is expected as flipping a ratio always gives the reciprocal.  It's only the ""and then ignore 100% to change perspective to a percentage more or less"" that makes the numbers harder to follow."
"Why is (100) 33% greater than (75), but (75) is 25% less than (100)?","One perspective is that percent decreases are bounded. You can decrease something by anywhere from 0% to 100%. Percent increases are not bounded. You can increase something by any positive percentage. 

A consequence of this is that when you're looking at the percent difference between two values, the percentage decrease from the larger value will always be smaller than the percentage increase from the smaller value. The percentage decrease will approach 100% as the difference between the values grows larger, but the percentage increase will grow without bound. To make these very different ranges ""match up"", every extra unit of percentage increase has to correspond to increasingly less percentage decrease."
"Why is (100) 33% greater than (75), but (75) is 25% less than (100)?","In each case you're comparing the difference to one of the numbers, but which number you compare it to is different. When you ask how many percent more 100 is than 75 then you are comparing the difference to 75. When you ask how many percent less 75 is than 100 then you're comparing the difference to 100. Since 100 is more than 75 the difference is smaller compared to it."
"Why is (100) 33% greater than (75), but (75) is 25% less than (100)?","Because 25 = 75/3 = 100/4. The result of division depends on the numbers. 

25 isn’t the same part of 75 and 100 because 75 and 100 aren’t the same. In particular, 100 is bigger than 75, so 25 is a smaller part of 100."
"Why is (100) 33% greater than (75), but (75) is 25% less than (100)?","It might seem at first glance unintuitive. But breaking it down: say X is 25% less than Y: that means X = Y \* (1 - 0.25).

If Y is then 25% more than X, it means that Y = X \* (1 + 0.25).

Plugging this in, you get X = X \* (1 - 0.25)(1 + 0.25), so, assuming X and Y are not 0, 1 = (1 - 0.25)(1 + 0.25) which is not the case. More generally, say it is P% rather than 25%.

Then you would get 1 = (1-P)(1+P), and so 1 = 1 - P\^2. As you can now see, this scenario is NEVER possible, unless X = Y.

What is an alternative intuition for this? If X is less than Y, then the difference Y - X is larger, proportionally, to X than it is to Y."

"Why is (100) 33% greater than (75), but (75) is 25% less than (100)?","In your question, you are conflating addition reduction and expansion with geometric reduction and expansion.

If you have some value x and you reduce it by some amount a, you get `x - a`. If you then want to restore it, you add back a: `(x - a) + a = x`.

When reducing x by a factor f, you get `x/f`. To restore it, you need to multiply by f: `(x/f)*f`.

In the first case, the additive inverse of -a is +a. In the second, the inverse of 1/f is f. Compare the magnitude of these values to answer your question.

For the additive case: `|-a| = |+a|`.

For the multiplicative case, you're asking which ratio is farther away from 1, f or 1/f. How does `1 - 1/f` compare to `1 - f`? If we look at a case like 1/f=3/4, where we're reducing x to 75% of its value, to restore it we need to apply f=4/3, and the distance from 1 to 1/f is less than the distance from 1 to f.

This is because, when we multiply two numbers a \* b, imagine stretching a number line with a pin stuck in zero. When we multiply a \* b we are saying, if we stretch the number line (without moving zero) such that we send 1 -> b, where does a land? When we divide a/b, we do the opposite where we stick a pin in zero and shrink the number line such that we send b -> 1, and where does a land?

Because of what we're doing, when we divide by b, we are sending a to somewhere between 0 and 1 no matter how big b is. But when we multiply by b, we are not sending a to somewhere between 1 and 2, the change in a is going to be proportionally more. This is just the nature of what multiplication does: Big things get bigger than small things when multiplied, but not by the same amount, they get ""more bigger"".

That's why the inverse of 3/4 is only 0.25 away from 1 but 4/3 is 33% away from 1. It's just the definition of multiplication."

specific question about extraneous solutions . . .,"> BUT -3 is a valid solution as well . . . yet this is listed as extraneous . . . 

The square root operator [or in this case, the `[...]^0.5` operator] must be a *function*. This means it must return a single particular value.

We can't say that √9 is both 3 and -3, since we want ""√9"" to refer to a single number. Otherwise, we'd run into problems: could ""√9 + √9"" be 6, -6, or 0? That means √9 + √9 can't be equal to 2√9. That would be a mess!

So when we say ""**the** square root"", we mean ""the *principal* square root"". There are two of them, of course, but we've chosen that we always mean the positive one: if we want the negative option too, we have to say that explicitly with ±."
specific question about extraneous solutions . . .,"I'll answer why we get an extraneous solution. 

Squaring both sides is not a reversible operation. We can say that if x=y then x\^2 = y\^2 , but we cannot say that if x\^2 = y\^2 then x = y. In fact, we can only say that x = y or x = -y. 

The logic works by:

If (x+10)\^0.5 = x-2, then x = 6 or x = -1. 

But, we cannot say that if x =6 or if x =-1 then (x+10)\^0.5 = x-2 .  We have only shown that these are the candidate solutions. We may have no solutions. 

For example, if sqrt(x) = -1 then x = 1.  But if x=1, then sqrt(x) is not -1."
specific question about extraneous solutions . . .,"THE square root is nonnegative. Therefore x-2 has to be nonnegative as well, meaning ""solutions"" you might get with a value less than 2 are not valid.

In this case, you get them because by squaring both sides, you lost some information. You can do the step backwards and see for yourself that

(x-2)^2 = x+10 implies
x-2 = sqrt(x+10) OR x-2 = -sqrt(x+10)"
specific question about extraneous solutions . . .,"The 1/2 power is defined as the principle root. It wouldn't make sense to include both positive and negative values in the definition of x^(1/2) because it would cease to be a function. 

If it helps, think about when you actually solve a quadratic equation with an irrational square root as the solution. E.g. x^2 - 2 = 0. We say the solution set is plus 2^(1/2) AND - 2^(1/2) . Just writing 2^(1/2) does not encompass both the positive and negative roots, it is defined as the principal root, the positive square root."
"Permutations and combinations, not plug and chug?","For permutations and combinations, the most important thing to figure out is if the order matters or not.  If the order of your selection matters, you choose permutations.  If it doesn't, you choose combinations.

Permutations are the same or bigger than combinations since they have more different solutions.  Combinations you divide the permutation result by the ways you can arrange identical items.  Understanding how the formulas get built lets you tweak them when necessary.

For example, let's do a question like this.  You have four different marbles and six spaces, how many different ways can you arrange the marbles on the spaces?  Well you know the marble order matters since they are different, but the space order doesn't since they're both identical - just blank spaces.  So you do a permutation, which is 6! to capture all arrangements of marbles and spaces, then divide by the number of ways you can arrange the identical blank spaces, which is 2!.  The answer would be 6!/2!, or 360 ways.

This deeper understanding 'under the hood' helps when you get presented with more complicated questions where the order matters for some elements but not for others, because you can combine permutations and combinations."

Understanding derivative of inverse of a function in an intuitive way,"You seem to be implying that the derivative of g(x) is

(1 / f'(x)) * g(x)

which isn't true.  (Try it for a basic function like f(x) = x + 1, so g(x) = x - 1: f'(x) = 1, g'(x) = 1, but according to your formula g'(x) = 1/1 * (x-1) = x-1?)

The correct result is that if g(x) is the inverse of f(x) then its derivative is

g'(x) = 1 / (f'(g(x))

A derivation that is reasonably intuitive is... 

if f(x) has gradient dy/dx at point (x,f(x)), 

then g(y) has gradient dx/dy (because we flip the axes) at point (f(x),x) which is (y,g(y))

so g'(y) = 1/f'(x) = 1 / f'(g(y))."
Derived this thing. It's pretty useless but I did. It gave a pretty cool insight.,"You just discovered ""roots-of-unity filters"" via generating functions -- good job!

This identity can be used to model decimation in digital signal processing, i.e. when you only take every n'th sample of a sequence ""xk"", and set the remaining samples to zero. To be precise:

    yk  =  xk * rn(k),    rn(k)  :=  /1,  k = 0 (mod n)  =  (1/n)*∑_{v=0}^{n-1} exp(i2𝜋kv/n)
                                     \0,  else

Due to multiplication by ""rn(k)"", the sequence ""yk"" only contains every n'th sample of ""xk"", and zeroes in-between. The representation of ""rn(k)"" by the sum containing n'th roots of unity gives this filtering its name."

The first thing I’d note is that you only need to check in the interval [-1, 1] — do you see why?

The next thing I’d look at is the value of the derivative on either side of the zero you found (still limiting yourself to [-1, 1]), and think about what that tells you regarding where the function is increasing or decreasing, and so whether it’s possible to find another zero in that interval. "

How do I prove that sin(x)-x is a surjective function?,"A lot of people are commenting, but a lot of the answers are very incomplete and unhelpful. I’ll tell you the general proof strategy that uses your proposed strategy, but you have to fill in the blanks. I’m only going to structure for you the general strategy that people are trying in this thread, and you should seek almost no further help outside of this comment because I’m practically giving you the answer.

0. Go to Desmos and plot the function. You should conjecture that the function always decreases. The mathematical term for this is strictly decreasing. A function is called strictly decreasing if given any a and b where a < b, we have that f(a) > f(b). We will prove that this is true. There are different strategies for doing this. I’ll give you a direct one.

1. Recall that a function is strictly decreasing over any interval where its derivative is strictly negative. Please compute every single interval where the derivative is *strictly* negative. Note, this is very easy to see, and should therefore be very easy to prove. This implies that if you pick an and b in the same interval, then you get the desired statement, f(a) > f(b).

2. Check what happens when you try points in different intervals. You should obtain the exact same inequality. To prove this, you have to recall (once again) that sin(x) is bounded above by 1 and below by -1. You’re very close to being done; you can pick almost any a and b and if a < b, then f(a) > f(b). Note, for a beginner, this step is tricky.

3. Notice that your intervals include *almost* everything. That’s ok, now you have a decision to make, and every decision will work because this is a classroom exercise. How do you modify your intervals so that the union of all of them includes everything? I suggest half open/half closed intervals, that is, you should modify each interval to be half open and half closed. You should check the previous two steps to see what happens if you had done this from the start, and you’ll see this  would have worked there too.

4. Now you’ve established f is strictly decreasing. This implies that it’s injective, so if there is a solution to sin(x) - x =0, it’s the only solution. Obviously, 0 is a solution, so it’s the only solution.


I strongly suggest you soak in what the main challenge is in the problem and what you can learn from it. My guess is that sometimes, you have to mess with intervals is the lesson. Now you do the dirty trick in math; you pretend that you saw from the start that the half-open intervals was the right thing to do and you erase any intermediate work that led you there."

*sin(a) - a = sin(b) - b*,           
*[sin(a) - sin(b)] - [a - b] = 0*,           
*sin(a) - sin(b) = a - b*.

Clearly this is true for when *a = b*. But is there a way it can hold when they are different?"
How do I prove that sin(x)-x is a surjective function?,"You could use the following: If there were two points y < z where x and sin(x+1) intersect, then x and sin(x+1) would have the same average rate of change on the interval [y,z] (draw a graph if you want to see this). However, x has an average rate of change of 1 on any interval, while sin(x+1) has an average rate of change of less than 1 on any given interval, so there can be no two points of intersection. 

If you want to prove the latter statement, consider that the average rate of change is 1/(z-y) ∫cos(x+1)dx, where the integral goes from y to z. This is because that's the average of cos(x+1) on [y,z], and cos(x+1) is the rate of change of sin(x+1) (and you can use the FTC to formally prove it). But since cos(x+1)<1 except in isolated points, the integral is always less than z-y.

The same argument can be applied to the functions 0 and sin(x+1)-x, of course, but it's slightly more cumbersome."

Understanding derivative of inverse of sin x,"I'd begin by asking if you know that arcsin(x) is not the same as 1 / sin(x)? The notation sin⁻¹(x) can be a little ambiguous. For  f = sin, it is the same as saying f(x) = sin(x) for all x. In other words, the function ""f"" is equal to the function ""sin"". Whereas something like y = f(x), is saying that the variable y is defined equal to the result of applying f to x. It's a common abuse of notation to conflate variables with the functions that define them."
Complete the square.,"The square of ax + by is:

(ax + by)(ax + by)

= a^2 x^2 + 2abxy + b^2 y^2

You have x^2 + 4xy. Set like terms equal to each other:

a^2 x^2 = x^2

Assume the leading term is positive and you get a=1. 

2abxy = 4xy

2(1)bxy = 4xy

bxy = 2xy

And so b=2. 

And so we get:

(x + 2y)^2 = x^2 + 4xy + 4y^2

Or:

x^2 + 4xy = (x + 2y)^2 - 4y^2

With practice, you can do all of these steps in your head just by asking “What do I need to add to make this a perfect square?” and then remembering to subtract off whatever you added. Had you selected a=-1, then you would have gotten b=-1, which would lead to:

x^2 + 4xy = (-x - 2y)^2 - 4y^2

 = (-(x + 2y))^2 - 4y^2

 = (-1)^2 (x + 2y)^2 - 4y^2

 = (x + 2y)^2 - 4y^2

That is, you would have gotten the same answer. Hope that helps."
Complete the square.,"x^2+4xy+4y^2=(x+2y)^2. So then completing the square would be x^2 + 4xy +4y^2-4y^2= (x+2y)^2 -4y^2.

Basically you wanna make something that can be factored as (x+__)^2  and you need x(__)=4xy/2=2xy. And so __=2y and you must add and subtract (2y)^2 in order to be able to get the factor (x+2y)^2. I’m sure it can be explained better idk but that how I think of it."

(x+2y)^2"
Complete the square.,"It works like this:

a\^2x\^2 + 2abxy + b\^2y\^2 factors as (ax + by)\^2

If you want to create a nice factor like that, then you can just add or take away some values to get there.  That's 'completing the square', so you can create a nice factor.

So in this case you have the first two terms, which are a = 1, 2ab = 4, which means ab = 2, and since a = 1, b = 2.

So now you know that you need to create the third term, the b\^2y\^2, which is 2\^2y\^2, or 4y\^2.

But remember that when you add something, you have to also take it away to preserve equality.  So you would write this:

x\^2 + 4xy + 4y\^2 - 4y\^2

And then factor the square like so:

(x + 2y)\^2 - 4y\^2

This can be useful for some stuff (like deriving the quadratic formula or putting a quadratic into vertex form for example)."
Why is 0^0 is 1?,"ok, so u/Chrnan6710 has given a partially complete answer, which specifically answers what happens when you have limits of the form 0\^0. ""0\^0"" as an expression isn't indeterminate, that's  a specific piece of limit jargon, but otherwise the comment is ok. 

The other two comments (at the time I'm posting this) are utter nonsense. I'm going to try to give an answer that actually answers your title question. So, outside the context of limits, there's a question of definition. In set theory and combinatorics, x\^y is often defined as the number of functions from a set of size y to a set of size x. Intuitively, this is reasonable because if we have a function from a set with y elements to a set with x elements, we've got x ""labels"" to assign to y ""items"". Very concretely, a function from, say, {1, 2, 3, 4} to {0, 1} could be written as a binary string of length 4; I could write 1011 to represent the function that has f(1) = 1, f(2) = 0, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1. A specific function from {1, 2} to {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} could be written as 53, indicating f(1) = 5, f(2) = 3. 

The set you're mapping to can be thought of as your ""labels"" and the set you're mapping from are the things being labelled. So, with this idea, if you have 2 labels, and 5 items, you have 2 choices for each of the 5 things, which means there are 2 \* 2 \* 2 \* 2 \*2 = 2\^{5} total options. Reasonable!

Under this view, x\^{0} = 1 because, if you're labelling *no* items, there's exactly one way to do it. Behold: 

Tada! And the thing is, that works whether you're labelling no items with 3 available labels, or 5, or 20, *or 0*. In the context of combinatorics and set theory, exponents refer by defniition to this sort of counting thing. If you've got 0 labels and 0 items, there's one valid string you can make: the empty string. So, by this definition, it makes sense to have 0\^0 = 1. This means that, in context where the only possible exponents are whole numbers, we often take the combinatorial definition, and set 0\^0 = 1. 

Something of crucial importance is that under this definition, negative, fractional, etc. exponents don't make sense. Whenever any fractions/real number/negative exponents are happening, they're not referring to this combinatorics definition, they're referring to one of the other definitions of exponents. Under those definitions, you can take limits, and you are sad when you run into something of the form 0\^0, since such limits are undefined. This isn't a contradiction, just a result of the same notation referring to ideas that almost always coincide, but specifically behave differently when exponents are 0. 

Finally, convention is often to take the combinatorics definition when your only possible exponents are natural numbers. For example, if I write a polynomial as 2x\^0 + 3x + 4x\^2, it's understood that when I plug in x = 0, I should get 2. This is just a piece of notational convenience -- if the only possible exponents are natural numbers, using the combinatorial convention never leads to any ambiguity. From the perspective of limits, if your exponent is only a whole number, it only makes sense to take a limit of the base -- so the only limit that makes sense is lim\_{x -> 0}x\^{0}, which is just 1. This is still a slight abuse of notation, but it makes writing so many things easy that it's just commonly agreed this is easy.

tl;dr there are 3 things going on. In calculus/analytic contexts, 0\^0 shows up as a limit, and it is an indeterminante form of limit that may or may not be 1. In combinatorial/set theoretic contexts, 0\^0 refers to the number of functions from the empty set to the empty set, which is 1, so 0\^0 = 1 is a consistent, well formed, statement. Lastly, 0\^0 is sometimes taken to be 1 as a notational convenience, but only in settings where there is *absolutely* no ambiguity."

Why is 0^0 is 1?,"***It isn't.*** 0\^0 is indeterminate, which means it has different values depending on the circumstances."
Why is 0^0 is 1?,"It is but it isn’t. It is a simplification of the concepts that you are learning. It is undefined.
What your are learning is that x^0 = 1 If I take the power of a number less than 1, my result will the the root of 1/x. (So 2^.5 is equal to the sqrt2 and 3^.3333 is equal to the cubed root of 3). There is also the concept of negatives. Anything to the power of a negative will be 1/x^value so 2^-2 is equal to 1/2^2 or 1/4
In math, if you have 1/x, you will have an undefined variable. You find that out by putting x != 0 (!= means not equal). So 0 != 0 (empty space) 0 is undefined."
Why is 0^0 is 1?,"a. It's *not* in some contexts. In calculus, for example, 0^0 is what's called an ""indeterminant form"", meaning you cannot assign a unique value to it. But in combinatorics it *does* help to treat 0^0 like it's just 1.

4 gets you 79.

5 gets you 64.

**6 gets you 48.**

So the answer is 48!

… Ok obviously I was joking when I said I saw the pattern. Like I didn't figure this out on my own. I calculated this using technology

But this can be done with any of the other answer choices

You'll get **49** using this formula: *95 + (182 x)/15 - (19 x\^2)/2 + (17 x\^3)/6 - x\^4/2 + x\^5/30*

You'll get **50** using this formula: *94 + (173 x)/12 - (91 x\^2)/8 + (85 x\^3)/24 - (5 x\^4)/8 + x\^5/24*

You'll get **51** using this formula: *93 + (167 x)/10 - (53 x\^2)/4 + (17 x\^3)/4 - (3 x\^4)/4 + x\^5/20*

So, any of these answers could technically be correct. Which makes these kinds of questions sorta dumb…

I'm not sure what the answer was intended to be… I think 45 seems most reasonable to me too"

"Difference between Predicate, Proposition, and Truth Functions","I'll call the set of truth values 𝔹.

A predicate is a **relation** that takes in some number of inputs, and gives either a true or false statement.

Many authors define relations as subsets of the Cartesian product: so < on ℕ is defined to be {(0,1),(0,2),(1,2),(0,3)...}. Then they define functions from there, as relations that don't have two pairs with the same first coordinate.

But we can also take functions to be fundamental: then a relation is just a function whose output is in 𝔹.

A **truth function** is a function 𝔹ⁿ→𝔹: that is, a function that takes in *n* inputs, *all of which are truth values*, and gives you back 'true' or 'false'.

If you take the ""relations are functions to 𝔹"" point of view, this means 'truth function' is just a more specific case of 'predicate'.

A **proposition** is a statement that is either true or false. ""Proposition"" is generally used to refer to the *sentence* (or more precisely, the *meaning* of the sentence - the assertion being made), not a formal mathematical object. When doing propositional logic, we abstract these sentences into given variables."
"Difference between Predicate, Proposition, and Truth Functions","My understanding is:

Propositions are declarative statements we can make. They can (and often will) contain predicates and truth functions.

* **Predicates** alone are not statements. They are things like ""... **is prime**."" or ""... **is irrational**""  or even ""... **is a number""** (your example of ""<"" also counts, I was giving plain english examples but indeed in mathematics we typically use symbols.)
* Truth *functions* alone are not statements. They are things like ""... *and* ..."" or ""... *implies* ..."" or ""... *is not the case*"". (So yes, the operators you listed are right.)

If I say ""There **is** no **number** that is *both* **irrational** *and* **prime**."", or ""*If* a number **is prime**, *then* it **is odd**."", or ""two *plus* two **equals** five"" those are propositions, and they each contain a mix of prepdicates and truth functions (and some quantification).

We hope to use our axioms and the formal rules and definitions of our predicates and truth functions to determine the truth or falsity of prepositions such as these.."

"""Bad"" lecture notes and no proper textbook replacement (Question)","Start by visiting the professor, preferably during office hours, and discuss your concerns. You can explain the problem from your perspective. Perhaps they can recommend some resources that will help you. It may be that they haven't listed a specific textbook because textbooks are expensive and they didn't think it would help to ask every student to spend $100 or more on a book that might not be needed. In any case, talking to them will help you start to build a relationship.

Go to office hours when you don't understand something. You'll get another shot at understanding, and you'll show the professor that you're taking their class seriously. If enough students show up asking the same questions, they might change their opinion about whether a textbook would be helpful.

If none of that works, you can complain to the department chair. That's less likely to get you the help you need directly, but if the instructor isn't doing a good job teaching you might help to create a change."

Does exponential graph b have to be bracketed?,"It's hard to understand exactly what you mean, but here is some information that I hope will be helpful:

• 2^(x) and (2)^(x) are the same thing. The parentheses (or brackets) don't matter. But -2^(x) and (-2)^(x) are different things. The parentheses do matter here. Cause what if you plugged in x = 4? Well, -2^(4) is -16. But (-2)^(4) is 16.

• b^(x) and (b)^(x) are the same thing. Parentheses don't matter. Even though *b* can be negative, you still don't need parentheses. But, **the moment you actually plug a negative number into b, now you do need parentheses.** Like, if you plugged in b = -2, then it would need to be (-2)^(x)

• But yeah, normally in the general equation of an exponential function, people don't actually allow *b* to be negative, because of imaginary numbers as you said… and also cause the function's outputs for negative numbers would just be all over the place. Like, if you tried to graph it, it would be a bunch of points all over the place that don't form a curve. Which is weird. So we don't consider that an exponential function"
Does exponential graph b have to be bracketed?,"if you have -a^(x) without brackets then that's just an exponential with a positive base, then multiplied by -1 afterwards. If it has a negative base then that should mean a negative number to the power of x"
Does exponential graph b have to be bracketed?,"When you put a variable in the exponent, it creates an exponential function.   

An elementary purpose for an exponential function is to model situations where a value grows or decays at a rate proportional to its size.

Squaring and conversion of units,"Using your example, if you have 12 m^2 you can think of it like 12 one meter by one meter squares. If instead you want to think of it in terms of cm^2, each of those one meter by one meter square is composed of 10,000 one centimeter by one centimeter squares, but you still have 12 squares overall, not 144.

Algebraically we define 1m = 100cm, so if we square both sides we get 1m^2 = 10,000 cm^2. You don't multiply by (100 cm^2 /1m^2 ) and then square it, you square (100cm/1m) and then multiply"
Squaring and conversion of units,"Let's look at a simpler example. Say you have an area A=1m\^2. It doesn't matter what the shape is, you can picture it as a square with sides of length 1 m. Now picture a square centimeter: a square with sides of length 1 cm. How many square centimeters can you fit in the square meter? The answer is 10000. 

Picture filling in your big square with the little squares. Start at the bottom and make a row of little squares. You can fit 100 of them because the sides are each 1 cm, and you can fit 100 cm in a meter. Now create a second row above the first. You now have 200. Keep going, and you can fit 100 rows in the big square. In the end you have 100 x 100 little squares. 

Now you have 12m\^2. Picture 12 actual squares (the bigger ones). If each of those squares can fit 10000 little squares, and you have 12 of them, you can fit 12\*10000 overall. Hopefully that last part will help you see why you don't square the 12."

I’ve been working with this problem. Need some suggestions.,"The answers here in principle depend on where the random walk starts, so I'm just going to assume you start at 0. 

Convergence in this case probably means a.s. convergence. I think you are right that V_n is not bounded, but since it defines a martingale which is bounded above you can still apply the martingale convergence theorem anyway. Likewise with U_n.

For (5), note that the martingale V_n has a limit V a.s. by the martingale convergence theorem. What does this mean about the stopping time 𝜏? Because if 𝜏 = ∞, then morally this means V_n ""bounces around"" forever. Is that possible if you have a limit?

For (6) you don't really need properties of conditional expectation, the optional stopping theorem applied to the right martingale is enough.

Your suspicion for (7) is half correct; one of the probabilities is 1, but the other is not. Note the answer is going to depend on whether p > 1/2 or p < 1/2.

For a solution with explicit details, see Durrett Probability Theorem 4.8.9. It does not answer everything directly but it should give you very strong pointers on how to proceed for most of the claims."

How is it possible to express the roots of a 7th degree polynomial with only square and cube roots?,"It's hard!

For polynomials in general this is factorization.  If you have (x^2 - 2)^2 (x^3 - 3)  you have a degree 7 polynomial whose roots are really those of a quadratic and cubic. 

For polynomials of degree [5 or higher](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintic_function) there is no guarantee that radicals alone can express a solution.  Galois is another good reading item here. 

For roots of unity,  x^n - 1, things are more limited but still very complicated.  First note you can always factor out an x-1 and get a degree n-1 left.  Then there's Gauss's incredible work showing that you get only sqrt's when n is a Fermat prime,  which are also the constructible (straight edge and compass) divisions of a circle. 

You can probably get much better answers.  This is just to demonstrate that it is not an easy problem."

how can reddit help me become a better teacher?,"I am neither a mathematician nor a teacher, so I am definitely not qualified to answer this, but I’m going to anyways.

I think helping others on reddit can help with teaching because people ask all sorts of questions from varying levels of understanding. As someone who in the process of teaching myself undergrad math, I ask a lot of questions on the math side of reddit. I get a lot of answers from people who have a more formal approach to math than I do, and a lot of these answers can be really intimidating. 

When I’m confused, I usually find that my confusion comes from a misunderstanding of prerequisite material, or a false assumption about what we are trying to achieve. I think most confusion comes from some combination of these two things, and that that combination will be different for each person. The challenge with teaching imo is recognizing these misunderstandings and assumptions while coming from a place of understanding yourself.

With reddit, I think you can get good practice recognizing the unique ways people get confused, and correcting those misunderstandings in a way that isn’t confusing itself. When I’m asking a question about a topic, the last thing I want is for someone to re-explain the topic to me using formal logic. I literally just watched a lecture and read the textbook. What I need is for someone to reframe the topic in a way that uniquely makes sense to me. 

Oftentimes, when I really want an answer, I’ll ask the same question in a few different ways over the course of a week. I’ve learned through experience that this gets me the best chance of really “getting it”. Not only am I getting more replies from unique users, but by slowly refining my question, people are prompted to answer differently. Eventually, someone gives an answer that is just right to help me reframe the concept and understand the topic. 

I think part of the problem with reddit however is that it is self selecting. People who ask questions on a particular sub are likely inquisitive and willing to seek help simply because they chose to go on the math reddit. Im sure there are challenges teaching 11th graders that using reddit simply cannot help you with."

Question about teaching inverse of f(x),"Intuitively, I would say mirroring over the line x=y is quite understandable.

Also analogous to plotting f(x) on the horizontal and x on the vertical as opposed to the more traditional horizontal x axis."
Question about teaching inverse of f(x),"A good way to think of it is the inverse is the function g such that f(g(x)) = x = g(f(x)); when we swap x and “y,” we are effectively going backwards through all the operations.

For example, when we have y = 2x + 5, we multiply x by 2 then add 5.  When we swap x and y, we get x = 2y + 5 => y = (x - 5)/2.  Since + 5 was the last operation done, we do the inverse operation of - 5 first,  and since * 2 was the first operation done, we do the inverse operation of / 2 last.

We are basically retracing our steps in the opposite direction to get back to the original value, x.

Now graphically speaking, we can view this as a reflection over y = x, but this doesn’t really give what we are actually *doing* justice.  I think it’s a bit of a misnomer to view it purely graphically, since it side-steps the intuition of what the inverse truly means."

However, something like f(x,y) = 2x^(3) \+ 5y has a different slope in different directions (e.g. the slope in the x-direction is 6x^(2), but the slope in the y-direction is 5).

How much should proofs 'click',"I feel there's many proofs that are unintuitive. So long as you understand each step, and so long as you can prove things, it doesn't really matter whether or not they ""click""."
How much should proofs 'click',"some proofs are written in a way that they intuitively ""click"" but not every proof must be like that. the ""click"" sensation probably comes from gaining some insight from the proof eg how some properties interact with each other, however longer proofs might have too many side steps going on that certain insights get lost in this noise."
How much should proofs 'click',"It depends on the proof. For lots of proofs, there are a couple of key ideas (one or two for the standard proofs in introductory courses, more for maths papers).
The rest is mostly set up, bookkeeping, and showing the ideas work as expected.

Those kinds of proofs should ""click"" in the sense that you understand the main ideas and why they lead to the result. This is better than just step-by-step understanding since you can reproduce the proof by remembering the key ideas and then filling in the technical details (with a reduced need to remember those as well).

However, there are also proofs that are mainly the accumulation of such technical steps without those strong underlying ideas. Those can't really click."
How much should proofs 'click',"Not every person is a ""proof"" person. Think about Pythagorean Theorem: it's a rule almost everyone taking math knows, but very few know the proof. That's ok.

How much should proofs 'click',"It definitely doesn't happen with every proof and, as others have mentioned, there is value in getting comfy with ""trusting the process"" and understanding that if all the steps are sound then the result is sound.


That said, some proofs absolutely do ""click"" and I find those to be the fun ones. Absolutely nothing wrong with being dissatisfied when proofs leave the concept confusing, but it definitely will happen sometimes


A lot of theorems also will have multiple proofs, some more intuitive than others. If you're finding the concept frustratingly confusing it's worth looking around for alternate proofs that click better"
How much should proofs 'click',"Don't worry, experience will solidify your understanding of proofs. IMO you shouldn't worry that much wether proofs ""click"" for you or not, that just comes uo with time. What's really important is wether you can fully comprehend what it is saying.

But keep in mind that different subjects have different ""proof styles"" if i could phrase it that way. For example, in Analysis (or Calculus) proofs usually revolve about some banter about an epsilon or a delta, and a lot of inequalities. Personally, it was very hard for me to get used to these kind of proofs, but there's nothing in the world that you can't learn :)."
How much should proofs 'click',"You should try to make proofs click, you can ask about the intuition of a proof, you can work on proofs trying to make them so they just work for the simplest case, you can change the requirements and see how they 'break'...

But man... some proofs don't click until years later and some never clicked for me."
How much should proofs 'click',"Human intuition is a marvelous thing.  It has allowed humans to live and evolve for millions of years.   Humans have unrivaled capability to visualize a problem and to abstract solutions. 

However, humans are stuck in this evolution.  Most people still visualize numbers by counting on their fingers.    There are some mathematical concepts that push the limits of human intuition.   

For example, you can’t solve all quadratic equations visually because it requires you to visualize negative area.     Instead, we use formal algebra.  We develop an intuition for form and not function.  Proofs are more about understanding form than what the proof is trying to say.   Proofs will “click” on that level."
I found a neat trick when counting averages,"Not sure what you're trying to say here. Are you suggesting that the mean of 4, 2, 3 and 6 is 5? Shouldn't it be 11?"
I found a neat trick when counting averages,"Close, but you need to add the 6 back to the 5 and get 11"
I found a neat trick when counting averages,"4, 2, 3, x = 5

Yeah basically what you are doing is

 ((5×3)-(4+2+3))+5=x

Where the first 3=n and n=the number of summed values.

You just added instead of multiplied because it was more obvious. However, multiplying would be much faster when dealing with lots of values.

Like for example:

1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 20, 24, 25, 30, x = 20

((20×11)-(1+2+5+7+8+10+12+20+24+25+30))+20=x

220-144+20=96

X=96

You can also simplify the n to include the extra addition at the end. So n= total number of values + the single value of x values. Rewriting the first example is

(5×4)-(4+2+3)=x

Rewriting the second example with new n is

(20×12)-(1+2+5+7+8+10+12+20+24+25+30)=x"

2. Read the textbook, and take the time to understand everything. Don’t just do the homework problems. That’s not enough. Read the explanations, proofs, work through them yourself, ask your prof if there’s something in the text that’s not clear. 

In math you can’t squeak by without doing the real hard work. 

Bonus:
3. Turn off your goddamn phone and study. My friend quit her math professor job in frustration and moved to a farm in the middle of nowhere and gave up teaching since she realized all her students were stupid now since their attention span was about the length of a TikTok video. You’re screwed if you’re trying to read a textbook and your phone is distracting you every 10 seconds.  On the flip side, if you’re able to silence the phone nonsense and actually learn during college, you’ll be in the elite 1% while the rest of the people around you fade into idiocracy."

I had this fear of ""being wrong"", to mess up the presentation and then be evaluated ""false"", which made me so nervous that in the end I was unable to talk anymore.

I noticed that this was a bit like I was trying to fake myself into an evaluation I myself thought I didnt deserve, so I eventually ""resigned"" myself to the evaluation. I accepted that the evaluation will be fair, and their judgment is basically the truth no matter what. Since I cannot be judged unfairly, I cant do anything wrong while presenting.

Hey guys how long will it take for me to learn calculus and math 3 with a Highschool base,"I don't know what math 3 is, so I can't help you there.

As for calculus, it depends on how much high school math you remember and frankly how smart you are. Calculus just clicks for some people, while others struggle.

On average, a typical university class should take 130-160 hours of teaching+studying time.

Let's say you're studying 4 hours per day and have good studying skills, it should then take you 33 - 40 days to learn a university class worth of material. A reasonable estimate would be on the higher end - everyone has off days and sometimes you get stuck.

Calculus has 3 parts. Calc 1 covers derivatives, limits and basic integration. Calc 2 does real integration and introduces a lot of theorems and applications of calculus. Calc 3 covers all calc 1&2 material and extends it to multiple variables or dimensions.

Each one should take you around 40 days, if you're committed. But also, if you only need to learn calc 1 for example you're much better off."

What makes this function not one-to-one by horizontal test,"If a *vertical* line crosses the curve more than once, then it's not a function at all: you can't have two f(x) values for a given x.

One-to-one requires passing the *horizontal* line test, ie if a horizontal line can hit the graph of y = f(x) twice (or more), then that means there is an x1 and x2 with the same f(x), meaning it's not one-to-one.

f(x) =  -3x^3 + x + 2 

is not one-to-one, and one way to see that is f'(x) = -9x^2 + 1, so f'(x) = 0 has solutions (+/- sqrt(1/3)), which means the graph of y = f(x) has a minimum and maximum, so there will be x values either side of those minimum and maximum where f(x) takes the same value.  Plot the graph of y=f(x) and you can easily draw a horizontal line that crosses it three times."

I don’t understand slope intercept equations and I have a test tomorrow,">And then it showes a graph saying the slope is 1 and the y-intercept is 0, Then the slope is 1 wirh the intercept 2 but the starting doenst look like that, I'm so confused

It's hard to explain that without seeing it -- could be that there's just a mistake in your book or something. But the gist of the slope-intercept form of an equation is pretty simple. An equation in slope-intercept form is written like this:

y = mx + b

where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. You probably already know that slope is the amount that the line's y-coordinate changes divided by the change in the x-coordinate, i.e. Δy/Δx (remember, Δ just means ""change in""). If you're reading the slope from a graph, just look at the change in y between x=0 and x=1. And y-intercept just means ""where does the line cross the y-axis?"" or equivalently, ""what is the value of y when x is 0?"".

So, on your test tomorrow (and forever after!), you might see a question like: *look at this graph and write the equation of the line.* OK, you can do that. Write down:

y = \_\_\_x + \_\_\_

First, look at where the line crosses the y-axis. As an example, let's say it's 3. Write that value in for b, which is to say in the rightmost space. Next, look at the value of y where x = 1. Let's say it's 5. If y is 5 at x=1 and 3 at x=0, then the slop is (5-3)/(1-0), which is 2, so write that in for m to get:

y = 2x + 3

Sometimes the y value at x=1 will be smaller than that at x=0. Using the same example, let's say the y value at x=1 was 1 instead of 5. Then the slop would be (1-3)/(1-0), which is -2, and the equation would be:

y = -2 + 3

You're also going to see questions where you get an equation and you're supposed to draw the line. This is exactly the same thing, but in reverse. Let's say the equation you're given is:

y = (1/2)x + 4

Start with the y-intercept again. It's 4, so draw a little dot on the y-axis at y=4. Now you need another point in order to draw a line. You can plug any value you want in for x and the equation will tell you the value of y. An easy one is x=1, which gives you y=(1/2)\*1 + 4, or 4.5. But it's often easier to draw a better line when the points aren't too close, so try x=10, which gives y=(1/2)\*10+4, or 9. Put another dot at (10, 9). Now just connect the dots.

Finally, sometimes you'll be given an equation that's not in slope-intercept form. You might be asked to graph it, or just to put it in slope-intercept form. In that case you just need to use the rules of algebra to isolate y on one side and the rest on the other side, simplified as much as you can. Let's say you're given:

2x + 3y - 5 = 1

You can simplify that by first adding 5 to both sides:

2x + 3y = 6

then subtracting 2x from both sides:

3y = -2x + 6

and finally dividing everything on both sides by 3:

y = (-2/3)x + 2

And there you have it: a line that slopes moves downward 2 units for every 3 units it moves to the right, and crosses the y-axis at y=2."
I don’t understand slope intercept equations and I have a test tomorrow,"Ok best way to understand it.

y=mx+b

Let’s dissect this

m is the slope, i.e how steep it is when you graph it.

x is pretty much a basic placeholder.

\+b(or minus b) is the point where the line when you graph it, where it crosses the y axis.(when I mean a line, it’s just a linear equation. A linear equation is an equation that does not have x and y being multiplied by each other, or having exponents. An example of this)

y=2x+5✅Linear. (When you graph it, it’ll look like a line

y=2x^(2) \+2x+5❌not linear(looks like a u shaped line called a parabola)

so, in the equation y=2x+5, the +5 is represented by (0,5) on a graph.

In the equation, the slope is 2, as it is multipling(the coefficient) of x, or the “m” term.

In order to graph a linear equation on a coordinate grid, you must start by going to the y intercept, or in this scenario the +5. So, you must go to (0,5) first. Now plot that point. Now, you must graph the slope. For this, think of the two as 2 over 1, or 2 ones. Whatever the top number is, from the y intercept point, go up or down that many on the grid, and go left or right the bottom number(numerator denominator) if the slope is positive, you go up and right, if it’s negative, you go down and left(I might be wrong abt this part. Now, if it is done correctly, you will have graphed a diagonal line. Sorry if this sounds confusing, or if I did poor explaining it. Here’s a graph as well to show it. (The image is for y=2x-5 but same concept)

I don’t understand slope intercept equations and I have a test tomorrow,">And then it showes a graph saying the slope is 1 and the y-intercept is 0,

That would be y = 1x + 0, putting 1 in as the coefficient (multiplier) on x, and 0 as the intercept that gets added.

But you can simplify that. 1x is the same as x. And adding 0 does nothing. So that equation is the same as

y = x

Is that the equation you saw that you're having trouble matching up with y = mx + b?

If you just see x, that means 1x so the slope is 1. So for instance y = x - 5 is the same as y = 1x - 5 and also has a slope of 1.

Also y = -x or y = -x + 3 are the same as y = -1x and y = -1x + 3, so they both have slopes of -1.

If you don't see a number multiplying the x, that number is 1.

If you don't see a number being added to the x, that number is 0."

I don’t understand slope intercept equations and I have a test tomorrow,"The formula for slope-intercept form of a line is: `y = mx + b`.
  m is the slope
  b is the y-intercept


Remember that the slope of the line is a ratio of rise-over-run. The y-intercept is where the line crosses the y-axis. Graphing the line is simple when you have the line in slope-intercept from. Start with your intercept. On the y-axis, go the number of units up for positive values of b or down for negative values of b and plot the first point, i.e. the point will be at (0,b). Then use the slope to find the next point on the line. Remember, the slope tells you rise over run. 


As an example let's look at the equation `y = ½x + 3`. b is 3, so the y-intercept is (0,3). That's the first point you would plot on the graph. Now we go rise over run to find the next point. The slope is positive so we go up 1 unit and to the right 2 units to (2,4). If the slope was negative, we would go down instead of up. So with two points plotted, we can now draw the line through those two points for the graph. 


Good luck on your test."

they're all derived from manipulating the basic equation."
I don’t understand slope intercept equations and I have a test tomorrow,"Okay. So, let's just talk about a simple line: y = x. 

Think about where the points for that line would be. Well, at y = 0, x = 0, at y = 1, x = 1. You basically get a 45 degree line running through the origin where the line goes up on the right and down on the left. Right? 

Okay, but what if I change the slope to 3? Well then the line is suddenly going to be y = 3x. So when y = 1, x = 3. Suddenly the line turns so that it's aimed more forward on the graph instead of perfectly diagnonal. 

Okay, so what about if I do y = x/3? Well now, the line suddenly goes vertically at the same angle as 3x. Every value of y will get divided by 3 instead of multiplied by 3 which will rotate it up towards the y axis. So the slope is whatever is multiplied by x in y = mx. 

Okay, but what if I start using negative numbers? Well, multipying any positive number by a negative number will make the result negative, so suddenly the line flips to go diagonal down. You can see this by graphing y = -1x. Suddenly it starts in the top left and goes diagonally down to the bottom right. 

What if I make y a constant: y = 3? 

Well, then you get for all values of x, a point at 3 on the y axis, so you get a horizontal line three units above the origin. 

And if x = 3, you'll get a vertical line at 3 to the right of the origin. 

Okay, but then how does adding a consant cause the line to shift up or down and why is that number the y intercept? 

Imagine now that you do y = 0, you get a horizontal line at the x axis. this is because the slope is 0, but where's x? Well, it's there, so you can put it like this: y = 0x. Whatever you add or subtract from 0x in that equation will cause that horizontal line to raise or lower by exactly that amount. Also, if you take your line with a y intercept and make x = 0, and solve for y, you'll get your constant. Here, watch:

```
y = 3x + 4 & x = 0 (so x is where the line crosses the y axis)

y = 3(0) + 4

y = 0 + 4

y = 4
```

x = 0 is where the y axis is. All up and down the y axis, every single point has x = 0. 

So y = slope * x + y-intercept. 

Adding and subtracting from x will shift y so that when x = 0 (canceling the slope) the line crosses at exactly what you added or subtracted from x. When you multiply or divide from x, you will change the rotation of your line at that y intercept.

Even if you don't have all the variables, they're still there. 

y = x? That's exactly the same as y = 1x + 0. The slope is still there, it's 1. The y intercept is still there, it's at the origin: 0. It works that way because adding zero does nothing to change the equation, and neither does multiplying x by 1 or any form of 1. You could also say the same about y = (3/3)x + 0. 3/3 is 1, so it's the same as y = 1x + 0, since multiplying by 1 and adding 0 doesn't change anything, it's the same as y = x. 

And as I demonstrated before, even if x isn't there, it is. y = 4 is the same as y = 0x + 4. That will produce a perfectly horizontal line 4 spaces above the origin.

Adding a negative number or subtracting will cause the line to drop below the origin, and multiplying x by a negative number will cause it to flip into a downward trending line. Adding a positive number will cause it to shift upward that many spaces from the origin, and multiplying or dividing a positive number will cause it to shift more vertically or horizontally between the x and y axes.

Discovering the Role of Integrals and Derivatives in Linear Regression,">In Simple Linear Regression, I noticed that the derivative is very useful to analyze the Total Squared Error (TSE). When the graph of TSE (y-axis) against the weight (x-axis) has a positive derivative, it tells us that increasing the weight increases the TSE, so we need to reduce the weights — because we’re on the right side of an upward-facing parabola. Is this correct?

Is the AOPS series appropriate for an adult learner,"Hey, AoPS Team here,

Great question! While our books were primarily designed for middle and high school students, we've found they work remarkably well for motivated adult learners too. The focus on problem-solving and deep conceptual understanding is valuable for learners of any age.

What makes our books different from standard textbooks is the emphasis on deep understanding and problem-solving rather than just procedural knowledge. You mentioned you got interested through our competition problems, and that's actually a perfect entry point! Our curriculum is built around developing that kind of flexible, creative thinking while still covering all the standard content.

For someone in your position who wants to ""learn from the beginning,"" our Prealgebra book would be a good starting point. Even though you're working through Pearson's pre-algebra now, our approach is different enough that you'll gain new insights rather than just covering the same material. The problems range from straightforward applications to challenging puzzles that develop critical thinking skills.

If you're concerned about whether you'll learn the standard content - absolutely, you will! Our books cover all the standard topics but approach them with more depth. We don't skip the foundations in favor of just teaching tricks. If you have any questions, our customer service team is always happy to chat. 

Good luck!

Can somebody please explain Integration by U-substitution as simply as possible?,"It makes use of the derivative chain rule.

dy/dx = dy/du \* du/dx

Hence if you want to integrate dy/dx, it is equivalent to integrating dy/du \* du/dx

Find a function u and calculate du/dx. Replace the x's in the original equation by the u-sub. Hence you now have the dy/du part which can be multiplied by the du/dx part. 

The thing that makes it easy is to choose u such that dy/du \* du/dx is a simpler integral wrt u rather than the original expression wrt x."
Can somebody please explain Integration by U-substitution as simply as possible?,"It is a combination of the chain-rule for derivatives, and the FTC. Recall

    chain-rule:    d/dx  F(g(x))  =  f(g(x))*g'(x)    // f(x) := F'(x)

Use the FTC on the above:

    ∫ f(g(x))*g'(x)  dx  =  ∫ d/dx F(g(x))  dx  =  F(g(x)) + C  =  (∫ f(u) du)_{u = g(x)}

In the last step, we substituted ""u = g(x)""."
Can somebody please explain Integration by U-substitution as simply as possible?,"Let’s say you have some function you are integrating, like f(x)=(3x+2)^2 for example. And the integral is on ( 3x+2)^2 dx. You want to replace the (3x+2) part with something that is easier to handle, so you set u=(3x+2). 

However, if you substitute that in, now you are left with u^2 dx, which isn’t good because you really need it to be in terms of du instead of dx.

To find the definition of du, you have to take the derivative of u. So in this case, du = 3dx. Rearranging, we get dx = du/3. 

We can substitute that in, yielding u^2 (du/3). Integrating that, we get (u^3 )/3 * (1/3) + c. 

Don’t forget to plug x back in at the end. Here, we get (3x+2)^3 * (1/9) + c."
Can somebody please explain Integration by U-substitution as simply as possible?,"It's literally just a symbolic substitution¹ that reverses the chain rule, you are introducing a new variable u that allows you to rewrite the integral in a more manageable form. The only thing you have to keep in mind is the (symbolic) formula

dy = y'dx [1]

For example, say you want to integrate the function (x + 3)⁹. You can surely expand the polynomial and integrate it term by term, but that would be quite pesky. It's much easier to let u = x + 9. Notice that the derivative of u with respect to x is u' = 1. This means that

dx = 1dx = u'dx = du (by [1])

So we can just rewrite the integral as the integral of u⁹du, which is much simpler

So the way you usually proceed is this: you find a suitable u for your problem, compute u' and see if you can find it as a factor in your integrand. If you can, you rewrite u'dx as du and integrate the new integrand with respect to u.

Let's try a more advanced example now: say you want to integrate √(1 - x²)dx. The substitution here is more subtle: x = sin(u) will do the job (notice that the relation is invertible, as the domain of definition of our integrand is [-1,1], where arcsin is bijective).

How? Well, x = sin(u) means that

√(1 - x²) = √(1 - sin²(x)) = cos(x)

(Again, we do not need the absolute value because of the domain we are dealing with.)

And dx = dsin(u) = cos(u)du (by [1]), so we have transformed √(1 - x²)dx into cos²(u)du, and this is much simpler (you can do it by parts or using basic trigonometric identities).

Don't forget to substitute x back into the final function, once you're done solving the integral with respect to u!

Spivak's Calculus Preparation,"I think Spivak's Calculus is a pretty good introduction to analysis. It is long, has plenty of examples and is fairly detailed in the exposition, so it should be quite accessible. The content is relegated pretty much to stuff you would learn in calculus 1 and calculus 2, except now everything is done ""properly"". Plus, you need this stuff pinned down before you can move on to other analysis concepts. Mastering epsilon-delta arguments is one of the core parts of analysis.

Calculus on Manifolds is a different story. This book is extremely compact, so it can be a pain to follow along, and in my opinion is more of an intro to differential geometry book than an analysis book. The only parts there which a modern analyst really cares about are differentiation in R^(n), inverse + implicit function theorems, partitions of unity and change of variables in R^(n) (and the proof there does not even work for Lebesgue integrals, so I don't know if I can even say that is useful either). If you are actually interested in continuing with analysis you'd be better off with something like Tao/Rudin/Pugh (although if you use Pugh, do NOT use it to learn Lebesgue integration.). I would also recommend having Munkres' Topology on the side once you get past Spivak, because a lot of foundations in analysis is really just topology. Having a clear understanding of point set topology clarifies a lot of the most basic ideas in analysis."

**Assumption:** You mean linear n-step recursions with constant coefficients.

There is, but you will need to do some theory to get there, depending on the way you want to approach recursions. There are (at least) 3 possible approaches, depending on your background knowledge:

1. Guess&check using an exponential ansatz
   * **Pro:** No background needed and simple to do, so it is often used in introductions.
   * **Contra:** Completely unmotivated. Does not scale well to natural frequencies with multiplicity, or inputs containing natural frequencies of the recursion. Sadly, you *will* often encounter these situations in practice problems

   ` `^( )
1. Rewrite n-step linear recursion as an nxn-system of 1-step linear recursions
   * **Pro:** Very elegant if done correctly, multiplicities of natural frequencies included
   * **Contra:** You need linear algebra, and knowledge of [Jordan Canonical Forms][1]

   ` `^( )
1. Use Z-transforms to solve the recursion
   * **Pro:** Elegant, and reveals the motivation behind the guess&check approach
   * **Contra:** You need to know Z-transforms. Only works for Z-transformable inputs, i.e. inputs growing (at most) exponentially. Most likely, that's all you encounter anyway, so not a huge deal

Do you have a representative example problem to show?

But x€M means x=a or x=b or x=c or x=d.

Case 2: if x = {A}, then x contains A and clearly X does as well.

Now in your case: if this chain exists, then A contains a D that contains a C that contains a B that contains A so something like A = {{{{A, and other stuff}, and other stuff}, and other stuff}, and other stuff}. Consider X = {A,B,C,D}. Apply foundation to obtain x.

What is the proof for this?,How else would you define b^(x) ?
What is the proof for this?,"Why not go the power series route to extend exponentials to arbitrary real exponents:

    b^x  :=  exp(ln(b)*x)    // exp: C -> C,   exp(z) := ∑_{k=0}^∞  z^k/k!

Now we don't need a supremum -- the power series is well-defined for all ""z in C"", so ""b^x "" is well-defined as long as ""b > 0"". The supremum property follows from monotonicity of ""exp(..)"" restricted to ""R""."
What is the proof for this?,"Absolutely, b\^x = sup{b\^t | t rational, t<x} does not follow from the field axioms of the real numbers, because they say nothing at all about exponentiation. Those axioms only discuss plus and times, so those are the only operations we take as ""given"" in real analysis. All other operations are ""man-made"", by which I mean ""we define them however we want"".

Of course, there are pre-existing strong conventions. It would be quite unusual to define b\^2 = b\\\*b\\\*b, because we have a pre-existing notion of what ""squaring"" should be, and for the most part it does not agree with ""multiply by itself thrice"".

If I understand you correctly, your issue with the definition of b\^x as the supremum of this set (that you call B) is that you have no guarantee that it agrees with your pre-conceived notion. This is what you are asking for a proof of, yes?

If this is correct, then any reasonable explanation would require knowing what your pre-conceived notion is. This is why other people are asking you for your definition of b\^x, and until you give an alternate definition, there is really nothing to \*prove\*. There is some value in arguing that the given definition agrees with common sense, but this would not consist of proving anything, which is why other posters are giving you flak.

Anyway, here is an attempt. I will assume b>1; for the case 0<b<1 a similar reasoning can be done.

First, prove that the function f(x)=b\^x is increasing for b>1. This can be done for rational x: comparing b\^(p1/q1) vs. b\^(p2/q2) can be done by taking the (q1q2)-th power on both sides, and this then reduces to the integer case, which is a relatively straight-forward induction.

This cannot be done for irrational x because we don't have a definition for b\^x yet (note the distinction between ""it isn't defined yet"" and ""we don't know anything about it""). Nevertheless, one can intuit that f(x)=b\^x, if reasonably defined for x irrational, should also be an increasing function. Thus, if x is irrational (or any number, really), one should expect that b\^x >= b\^t for all t<x, and that b\^x <= b\^s for all t>s. If we can show that there is only one number that satisfies both of these properties, that will be a very reasonable (and arguably the only reasonable) definition for b\^x. Note that in this definition we may only use t,s rational because we have not yet defined b\^x for x irrational.

So, it turns out that there is one, and exactly one, number that sits between the sets

B={b\^t | t rational <x}

and C = {b\^s | s rational >x};

that there is \*at least\* one follows from the fact that f(x)=b\^x is increasing (on the rational numbers) and completeness of the reals; supB and infC are both such numbers that sit between B and C. The fact that there is \*exactly\* one follows from bounding the distance between b\^t and b\^s in terms of the distance between t and s. If we can show that, for any tolerance epsilon, there exist t<x<s so this distance is less than epsilon, any two numbers that'd be reasonable to define as b\^x will be at most epsilon apart. This will be true for any epsilon, so any two reasonable definitions of b\^x will be a distance of <epsilon apart for any epsilon, and thus must be the same. In other words, there is only one number sandwiched between B and C, and supB = infC is it.

Some of that last paragraph definitely requires a little work to be properly proven, but it is doable without too much trouble. You may need Bernouli's inequality for some of it. Anyway, would this solve your issue or not quite?"

**Find a Relevant Equation**

Since I am trying to relate (dr/dt) to (dA/dt), I need to find a relevant equation that involves both r and A.

For a circle that equation is obviously going to be A = πr^(2).

**Implicitly Differentiate**

From that equation, I need to create a new equation that has both (dr/dt) and (dA/dt) in it. We do that by implicitly differentiating both sides of A = πr^(2) with respect to time.

As others here have pointed out, π is a constant, but both area and radius are changing over time. Since both A and r are functions of time, we will end up with an equation involving the variables (dA/dt), (dr/dt), and r.

**Plug in the Known Values and Solve**

Since we were told that (dr/dt) = +3 cm/sec and that r = 8 cm at the moment we are interested in, we can plug those values in and then solve for (dA/dt)."
Volume of parallelpiped without determinants,"Certified determinant hater. Did Sheldon Axler write this post?



You can of course use other methods to calculate volumes and areas for specific cases, but that's not really insightful. It's just a different formula. Your ""projection length \* width \* height"" thing basically yields the triple product and that's of course just the determinant via the usual formula.

The properties we'd naturally expect from a (signed) volume / area actually uniquely determine the determinant. That's why it's significant. Even if you call it something else and define in roundabout ways what you're dealing with will ultimately still be the determinant.

There is a very fundamental link between signed areas and determinants, and through this the determinant acts sort of like a bridge between geometry and linear algebra. Can you avoid the leibniz formula, laplace expansions etc.? Sure. But why would you?



Notably you can also use determinants on any vector space (and on sufficiently nice modules) where orthogonal projections and the like might not be available."
Volume of parallelpiped without determinants,"Haven't you just tricked yourself into computing the determinant in a different way? Since Jordan normal form exists and determinants is a conjugacy invariant, it follows that the determinant of a matrix is the product of all of its (generalized) eigenvalues (with multiplicity).

I agree with u/SV-97. The properties which uniquely specify the determinant are related to the volume interpretation, and similarly, any general process (meaning one that works for all matrices) for computing all the eigenvalues is essentially equivalent to solving the characteristic polynomial, if you look at it carefully enough. The idea that you can avoid determinants (at least, when dealing with a general matrix without some special properties) is an illusion. But the good news is that anything which makes you feel that you have avoided determinants and are better off for it, properly understood, contains a reinterpretation of what the determinant means which should make you feel better about the determinant concept.

I suppose I sympathize with you, even - defining the determinant as the product of the eigenvalues is a more natural and obviously meaningful quantity than defining it as a complicated sum of products of matrix entries in the usual way. But the point is that this latter equivalent definition is usually given first because it's something people can compute and understand (at least on a shallow level) with nothing but basic arithmetic."

Can u tell me the reason?,"You’re probably using a book that avoids discussion of infinite cardinals for accessibility reasons and because it is outside the scope of the material.

Can u tell me the reason?,"Lots of confusion here. I'll try to help, but I'm typing on a phone.


If A and B are finite sets, then A=B means that yes they have the same cardinality (number of elements) but ALSO (more importantly) that they contain the exact same elements.  This is set equality: A=B means A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A. 


If A and B are infinite sets, then again A=B means A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A, so equality between sets requires them to contain the exact same elements.  That would imply matching cardinalities, but the converse is not true. 


Since we can't just count the number of elements in an infinite set,  we say two (possibly infinite) sets A and B have equal cardinality if there exists a bijective (one-to-one and onto) function from A to B. This does not make A and B equal as sets though. 


Now set isomorphism as discussed in ""intro to proof"" type courses present the idea of isomorphism between sets as being just about cardinality.  Often we define the equivalence relation ≃ between sets by saying A≃B if and only if the cardinality of A is the same as the cardinality of B. 


If we have finite sets A and B then you could count the number of elements in each and say A≃B if they contain the same number of elements. 


For infinite sets, as discussed above, we can only say they have matching cardinalities if there's a bijection between them.  Since that also works great for finite sets, the usual way of defining ≃ for sets in general is to just say: A≃B if and only if there exists a bijective function from A to B. 


Example with finite sets:
If A={0,1,2} and B={x, y, z} then A≃B, but A≠B. 


Example with infinite sets:
If A={all positive even integers} and B={all positive odd integers} then A≃B, but A≠B.

Solving a cubic equation whose coefficients are successive primes.,"The polynomial, after dividing by the leading coefficient, converges pointwise to x^(3)+x^(2)+x+1 since the prime gaps, as function to the prime p before them, are o(p) (this is little-o notation), and so the ratios approach 1.

-1 is a root of this polynomial, the appropriately chosen roots of your polynomials will converge to it.

You’ll see the same behavior for any sequence of numbers where the difference between them becomes small as a proportion of the values."
Solving a cubic equation whose coefficients are successive primes.,"The other thread covered why the root converges to -1; as for why there's only one and it lies between -2  and -1, we'll need a little calculus and a little number theory. First the number theory. You've probably heard Bertrand's postulate, commonly summarized ""Chebyshev said and I say it again, there's always a prime between n and 2n."" Applied to primes directly, this tells us that if p, q are consecutive primes, q < 2p. (In fact, we can do a lot better: Nagura improved the bound to q < (6/5)p for p > 25. Bertrand's will do for this problem, though.)

Let the cubic be f(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s, with the coefficients being consecutive primes p < q < r < s. Then we have

q < 2p

r < 2q

s < 2r

To establish that there's a real root between -2 and -1, we can use the intermediate value theorem. First the easier one:

f(-1) = -p + q - r + s

= (q - p) + (s - r) > 0

So f(-1) is positive. Now:

f(-2) = -8p + 4q - 2r + s

= 4(q - 2p) + (s - 2r) < 0

using the inequalities from before. Thus f(-2) is negative, so f must have a root somewhere between -2 and -1.

Finally, how do we know there are no other roots? We'll need f to be monotonic, increasing in this case, so let's look at the derivative.

f'(x) = 3px^2 + 2qx + r

We want this to be positive always, and we know it is at least once (f'(0) = r), so all that's left is to make sure this quadratic has no real roots. Let's check the discriminant:

b^2 - 4ac = (2q)^2 - 4(3p)(r)

= 4(q^2 - 3pr)

We want a negative discriminant, so we want to prove that q^2 < 3pr. To prove it, note that

q < 2p and q < r

Multiplying these (safely positive) inequalities together gives

q^2 < 2pr

and 2pr is certainly less than 3pr. So we've proven that q^2 < 3pr, which gives us a negative discriminant, so f' is always positive, f is always increasing, and the root between -2 and -1 is unique."

The question is *not* about VS, it's about V^(S), which is the set of all functions f: S -> V. The addition and multiplication are defined pointwise:

(f+g)(s) = f(s) + g(s) 

(a f)(s) = a f(s)

Note that the addition and scalar multiplication on the right side of those equations are the operations in V, and on the left side of the equations, are the operations we are defining in V^(S). At no point do we reference or use any operation in S, even if some happen to exist.

Here are some practice problems for you first to understand this.

Let T = {1, 2}. Convince yourself that V^(T) is really the same vector space as V^(2) (made up of ordered pairs of vectors in V). 

Now let H = {1,2 3}. V^(H) is now V^(3). 

Now do S = N, the natural numbers, as you were thinking.

Now do the problem for a generic S, which is not necessarily a subset of any particular number system, and is just an arbitrary, potentially infinite set of any size."
"Suppose 𝑆 is a nonempty set. Define a natural addition and scalar multiplication on𝑉𝑆, and show that 𝑉𝑆 is a vector space. How is this possible to solve?","First, a note: VS is commonly called things like ""the free vector space generated by (or spanned by, or with basis) S."" I mention this because many people will not be able to guess what you mean by VS here without more context.

The ""natural"" addition and scalar multiplication on the free vector space VN generated by the natural numbers will have no relation whatsoever to addition and multiplication of natural numbers. The problem asks you to treat S as a set, which means not making use of any additional structure your set might happen to already have. Thinking of a set like the natural numbers which already has extra structure in the form of operations defined on it will just make things more confusing.

What we could later do after solving the problem, however, is use one of the binary operations of the natural numbers to turn the resulting vector space VN into a ring (without a unit, if you use the addition). So the extra structure on N can be translated to extra structure on VN. I leave the details as an exercise, since trying to describe them will just make things more confusing until you thoroughly understand the general construction of VS. (But if, by chance, you're familiar with the representation theory of groups, you might see that the group algebra of G is just VG with a multiplication based on the group operation of G.)"

How would you convince someone to learn math?,"I just started liking math this year as I began to take calculus 1. 1.

Additionally math including stats, calc, and linear algebra quite literally are neccesary to make games and run computers which run the world"

How would you convince someone to learn math?,"I agree with the other commenter who said you should find what motivates you with math, you should find something you’re interested in and see how math applies. There’s a ton of math in gaming, particularly in the physics calculations in games like battlefield. If you were to continue that hobby, eventually you’d see how the two fields overlap even if it isn’t obvious at first. For me, I like architecture a lot, and became interested in the physics behind how buildings stand up and that led me to doing a civil engineering degree and how it all relates. Math is everywhere in any aspect of your life, it all depends on how you want to see it applied and learn it for yourself. You likely won’t see the basic algebra be very applicable but more advanced stuff will become noticeably present. You can look up something, see how math is in it, and then learn the why and what behind that."
How would you convince someone to learn math?,"Different people fall in love with different aspects of math, and are motivated by different things. Try and figure out what kind of math might appeal to you.

If I was trying to appeal to someone, I would probably first try to show examples of where it is either practical in their life, how it relates to stuff they already care about, or maybe how math can help us figure out some cool unexpected things about the world around us.

With the practical thing, it would be more like learning some basic algebra and playing around with compound interest functions, setting up budgets and projecting that into the future.

For stuff you might already care about, it could be like looking at some of the math that might happen in your games, it could be graphing the experience to level curves, damage calculations and so on.

As for funny unexpected things about the world, it could be like showing the probability of laying out all 52 cards in a deck of cards in a specific order, or how many times you would need to fold a piece of paper, until its height would theoretically reach the sun.

Now none of these by themselves are actually teaching you ""math"" in its purest form, but its there to create a hook. Once you find something that piques your interest. Because once you start to see the math around you, or start to look at the way math is applied, you will run into situations where someone does something you don't understand, and your curiosity should carry you to figure out what they did and why.

That's when you really hit the ""learning math"" stage. When you start looking into the rules of math, build up a foundation and intuition that you start to build upon, and stack up, till you can understand and do all the math you encounter.

There's also lot's of content online to go look at, and see if there's anything that catches your fancy. From smaller puzzles such as on the youtube channel ""Andy Math"" to generally more abstract niche concepts on the youtube channel Numberphile."

To calculate the chance of at least one event occurring you first figure out the chance that none will occurring, which is (1-1/4)^3 = 27/64 = 42.2%.  Because the chance of failing is less than 50%, you should take this option over the 50/50."

How would you convince someone to learn math?,"It's common for people who have been heavy gamers to be anhedonic.  Gaming is a heavy dopamine releaser, with instant reward, and it makes the rest of life seem dull and grey.  If you get burned out on games, then it's hard to find a replacement.  Social media maybe, which similarly is optimized for maximum reward center stimulation.

The slower burn, more deeply rewarding stuff that goes beyond the sugar rush of games and media, the stuff where you learn, use, achieve, engage with people and have deep personal relationships, all the stuff that was put on hold because it didn't hit as hard as screen time, it's hard to switch to it.  It's going to feel a lot more dull, especially at first when your brain is used to being main-lined dopamine and it's so desensitized.

Keep it up.  Learn math, solve the puzzles that math provides, it's rewarding.  Learn other skills too, carpentry and computer programming and rock climbing and soccer - meet people, and take them up on the fantasy football league and the poker night and the drinks.  As you slowly detox from the dopamine rush from screens, you'll start to really enjoy it - and eventually find even more lasting happiness."
How would you convince someone to learn math?,">I dont even know why I even think about math. I dont like anything else. 


If you think about math without even wanting to, you're basically half way there.


Math can used for *anything*. It's explicitly the foundation of so much, including games, but you can find a way to apply it to anything you want in a way that should prove interesting, if not immediately useful. 


There are so many ways to work with math that most people aren't even aware of (it's not all algebra and arithmetic), and there are so many fields of study that you can eventually specialize in something that perhaps *literally* no one else has even thought of. 


And it's just a damn useful field of study. If you have no idea what else to do with your life, studying math as the first step towards doing *something* that will be interesting and/or lucrative is not a bad choice. You may need to pivot at some point, but it's hard to be *unable* to make a living with a math degree."

How would you convince someone to learn math?,"Gamer is a wide concept.

If you play some action video game, it most definitely has a physics engine that describes movement, jumping acceleration etc. These are all differential equation problems, solved with math. Even just the graphics itself, rendering each pixel is a math problem, full of linear algebra. Most programming (games included) rely on math, but I would still keep a distinction between programmer and mathematician. Every programmer knows some maths and today I'd say you can't really learn maths without picking up some kind of programming. If you are interested in programming, whatever it may be, you will need some level of math.

If you play some strategy game, this is closely intertwined with the math field of game theory. How does player A choose the best move at any time given it can model how player B would respond next turn, next 10 turns, next 30 turns. ""Minmaxing"" is closely related.

I don't really know if it takes any convincing... if you just want to understand how stuff works, the vast majority of physics, engineering, most sciences, the laws of those sciences are written in the language of maths. They don't really make sense without math. If you want to know how stuff works, exposing yourself to some math is a good idea.

Exactly which aspect makes you want to learn math is a bit individual."
How would you convince someone to learn math?,"Heres how i got into maths:

Start at the times tables, you'll start to notice alot of patterns reoccuring, which will spark your interest in patterns. This led to me every maths lesson trying to find quicker easier ways with my patterns.

Then it got to algebra, i used to hate it but because i was a coding fan, i just recognised them as number variables for certain equations. I always found strange patterns in square numbers aswell like this:

(n to the power of smthin - (n to the power of that smthin - 1)) ÷ n = n³ - n²

the method im trying to get is let your creativity run wild with ideas and solutions. Like if you want to enjoy modern language, make up your own and you'll start to see why others love the codewords and words in languages idk."

How would you convince someone to learn math?,"Not sure. But I can at least tell you when my friends and I (bunch of math PhD students) play games with other people, we operate differently. Especially if we want to win and the game isnt just pure luck.

I’m not saying we’re always winning. But as long as there is a high skill ceiling to a game (not just mechanically), we tend to find ways to optimize our ideas and win hard.

I’ve also seen this with other people like my brother and relatives. If we play a MOBA game like DotA2, or RTS like SC2, our principles and the way we approach these games are often very different.

At one point, you'll be on a game and sit there thinking of how you're accomplishing nothing at all. Sure, it's fun, but you're wasting time.

I recommend breaking into Unreal Engine or another free game dev program. You have actual concrete problems you need to solve and a lot of times math is the way to do it.

It’s hard to just do math in a vacuum if you don’t already want to do it, but add some context and “realness” by learning math only to do other stuff is much easier.

Any ideas?,"For uniqueness, you're basically using that every [*balanced ternary*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_ternary) representation of an integer is unique,
since 3^(*x*) - 3^(*y*) would then be *the* balanced ternary representation for 234.

Alternatively, you can use that [*base-three/ternary*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_numeral_system) representations are unique, and consider the related Diophantine equation

- 3^(*x*) = 3^(*y*) + 234

in that context.

Hope this helps. Good luck!"
Any ideas?,"for this problem, since the number is small enough, maybe a cheat-y way to do it is to see that 3^6 - 3^5 > 234, and show for any x > 6 and y < x, 3^x - 3^y will only be even bigger. So the solution has to have x < 6. Then you can show all the other 9 or 10 combos of x and y aren’t solutions. 

There’s probably a more elegant way to do it that I can’t think of though

edit: actually you can also maybe show there has to be a lower bound on x as well. Do you know how?"
Any ideas?,"Clearly x > y, so you could consider the difference between x and y - call it z, maybe - and write it in terms of it:

3^(x) \- 3^(y) = 3^(y+z) \- 3^(y) = 234

Then by factoring:

3^(y)3^(z) \- 3^(y) = 234

3^(y)(3^(z) \- 1) = 234

Now you've factorised 234 into the product of a power of 3, and a number that's 1 less than a power of 3. The possible powers of 3 that divide 234 are 1, 3, and 9, so the possible factor pairs it could correspond to are:

1 \* 234  = 234

3 \* 78 = 234

9 \* 26 = 234

Now since this factor pair should consist of a power of 3 multiplied by a power of 3 minus 1, all you need to do is check the other factors to see which fit the pattern. Then you can equate them to 3y and 3z - 1 and solve for y and x."

Math can be pretty cool -- there are patterns to it, there are applications in real life.  It's not just moving numbers and symbols around, though sometimes it's taught that way, which is sad.  Khan Academy will teach you moving numbers and symbols, but not always why math is important or how it is applied.  Not sure what level of math you are talking about here.  Some people like algebra and not geometry, or vice-versa.

There are books out there with fun math tricks and facts -- maybe check your public library.  Something like that is easy to read and may change your attitude about math, which may help your learning.

Understanding absolute value graphs,"if |y|=f(x) (which assumes f is always positive or 0) then it means we only know the magnitude of y but we do not know its sign, solving for y gives us therefore:

y = +-f(x)

|y|=|f(x)| means y is the same as f except the sign which gives us again:

y= +-f(x)

in both cases u would just plot f(x) and -f(x)

|y|=|f(|x|)| similarly implies

y = +-f(|x|)

which means similarly plotting -f(|x|) and f(|x|)

it's quite simple: consider how f looks like on the right of the y axis then mirror it to the other side, this will give you f(|x|)"

How do you lot mentally double and halve numbers?,"The way I double 4679:

How do you lot mentally double and halve numbers?,"Doubling is still pretty easy to do digit by digit, with just one little extra: while each digit doubles (mod 10) to an even number, if the digit to the right of it is 5 or more, it flips up and becomes odd.

So for 4679:

4 becomes 8 but has a 6 after it so it's a 9  
6 becomes 2 but it has a 7 after it so it's a 3  
7 becomes 4 but it has a 9 after it so it's a 5  
9 becomes 8

9358

Halving is the inverse, which is a bit weirder, but if you've internalized how doubling works, you can almost just read it off

For 6794

6 is even and has nothing before it so it came from doubling a 3  
7 is odd, so it came from adding 1 to a 6, which came from doubling a 3 or an 8; if it was an eight, the previous number would be odd though, so it was a 3  
9 is odd, so it came from adding 1 to an 8, which came from doubling a 4 or a 9; previous number was odd, so it was a 9  
4 is even, so it came from doubling a 2 or a 7; previous number was odd, so it was a 7

3397

  
Another way to think about how to halve it is by turning it into a sum of evenly halvable parts, where any odd digits you see have to be a result of the next part having a leading 1:

4682 = 4000 + 600 + 80 + 2 = 2 \* (2000 + 300 + 40 + 1) = 2 \* 2341

6794 = 6000 + 600 + 180 + 14 = 2 \* (3000 + 300 + 90 + 7) = 2 \* 3397"

How do you lot mentally double and halve numbers?,"Halving 6794 the brute force way:

- start at the left most digit. 6? Halves to 3. Easy. Next. 
- 700? Half way between 6 and 8 so it halves to 3.5. So first two digits are 33_ _ and I need to add 5 to the next one. Next…
- 9? Half that is 4.5. Adding the 5 from the previous one gives 9.5. So the first three digits are 339_ and I add 5 to the next bit. 
- last digit is 4. Half that is easy: 2, and then we add the 5 to get 7. 
- so final answer is 3397. 

Alternatively, instead of carrying 5s forward, you can treat steps with odd numbers as looking at the even number immediately before it and adding 10 to your next one. This is functionally the same as what I did above, but might be easier to handle in your head. **Fundamentally**, though, a lot of the speed/reliability for doing this in your head just comes down to practice and familiarity with mental arithmetic. You get better over time. 

Also, for numbers that are only a little less than a large number, you can do it a different way. 

- 6794? That’s 6 less than 6800, and we (should!) know that multiplication distributes over addition so…
- half of 6794 is “half of 6800 minus half of 6”. 
- half of 6800 is 3400. 
- half of 6 is 3. 
- so half of 6794 is 3400 - 3, which is 3397."
How do you lot mentally double and halve numbers?,"Doubling 4679:


1)  I see this number is less than 5000 and more than 4500. If you double those, you get 10,000 and 9,000. So I already know the final answer will be between 9,000 and 10,000. 


2) Then I see that 4679 = 4500 + 179. As before, 4500 doubled will be 9,000, so I just need to mentally double 179 and add that to 9,000 to get the final answer.


3) 179 is close to 180 and I know that 2×18=36, so 2×180= 360. So now I've got 9000 + 360. 


4) finally I subtract 2, as this was the difference between 179 and 180, doubled. This gets to my answer of 9358.




Halving 6794: 


1) I see 6794 is very close to 6800. 6800/2 is easy, it's 3400. So now I just need to adjust my answer of 3400 slightly to account for the small difference between 6794 and 6800.


2) the difference between 6794 and 6800 is 6. Half that is 3. 


3) I know that 3400 doubled is larger than the number we're halving, so I know i mustn't add that ""3"" to 3400, but instead must subtract it. So my answer is 3397."

How do you lot mentally double and halve numbers?,"what is it you are really trying to do?  Approximation is often more than sufficient to either get close or exact.   Eg 4679?

method 1: add 1.  4680 / 2 is trivial, 2340.  You can even correct for the error easily, you added 1, so its off by 1/2 ...

method 2: most significant 2-3 digits:  47/2 is 23.5 .. 2350.  Sloppy, but maybe its close enough.

what did we learn?  Lets do 6794.  
looks like 6800 to me.  3400 is half.  Good enough?  
not good enough? add 10 (off by 5): 6804 is 3402 off by 5, ->  3397 (exact). (granted this assumes you can do the subtraction in your head, another sticky point)

you are just trying to make it easier then if need be, error correcting for what you did.  Hopefully that makes some sense and helps?"
How do you lot mentally double and halve numbers?,"For doubling something like 4679 in my head, I would round it to the nearest easily doubled number, then account for the difference. For me, that easily doubled number would be 4700. 2\*4700 is 9400. 4700 is 21 more than 4679, so I need to double 21 to get 42, then subtract 42 from that 9400 to get 9358.

All that said, there might be some tricks that could make it easier for you, but why do you need to do this?

If accuracy matters, use a pencil and some paper or a calculator. I can't think of many situations where you would need to do precise mental arithmetic very quickly without access to one or the other.

How do you lot mentally double and halve numbers?,"A good approach to mental math sometimes is to compute what happens to the difference instead of number itself. For example, if you think about 4682 as 328 less than 5000, then doubling it will put you at 652 less than 10K, and halving it will put you at 164 less than 2500.

Likewise, if you want to halve 6794, think about it as `1/2*(6800 - 6) = 6800/2 - 6/2 = 3400 - 3`.

There's a similar trick you can use for squaring numbers near 50:

    53^2 = (50 + 3)*(50 + 3)
    = 50^2 + 2*3*50 + 9
    = 2500 + 3*100 + 3^2

This is super easy to do in your head, just get the rough answer by noticing that this is 3 more than 50, so the square is about 50\^2 + 3\*100 or 2500 + 300 = 2800. If you want the exact answer, then add 3\^2 for 2809.

Works in the other direction too, but subtract the hundreds and still add the square, so 46\^2 = 2500 - 400 + 4\^16 or 2116."

How do you lot mentally double and halve numbers?,"Notice that I'm sort of person who can't keep numbers in head - I can only calculate if I see numbers written out. But the way I do it is roughly as follows.

Doubling: I inspect if any number is 5 or more and note their placement. They add 1 to the number to their left. Then I start by doubling. Your example: 4679

6, 7 and 9 are all above 5. Number to the left will turn odd

4 -> 8, +1 because next is 6 -> 9

6 -> 12, keep only last number -> 2, +1 because next is 7 -> 3

7 -> 14, keep only last number -> 4, +1, because next is 9 -> 5

9 -> 18, keep only last number -> 8

Thus 4679*2 = 9358



Halving: I go number by number. If number is even, I halve it. If it's odd, I halve one below and add 5 to next. For your example - 6794:

6 -> 3

7 -> 6, 5 to next -> 3, 5 to next

9 -> 8, 5 to next  -> 4 plus 5, 5 to next -> 9, 5 to next

How do you lot mentally double and halve numbers?,"For doubling 4679, I might instead double (4)(6)(8)(-1), which doubles to (8)(12)(16)(-2), which simplifies to 9358.

The negative digit trick is usually more effective when there's only one large digit, but you get the idea.

For 6794, I might make it (6)(6)(18)(14), which halves to my 3397"
How do you lot mentally double and halve numbers?,"4679
First I know 45 *2 is 90.
So 4500 -> 9000
That least 179 left which is close to 180. 180 doubled is 360. Thus I minus 2 from 360 and add it to 9000 for a fast doubling. 

Halving isn't as intuitive, but it's pretty close I know 4600/2 is 2300. So there's that, and then 79 is left. Which is basically 80/2 = 40, thus 2340. If you need a perfect half then you do 80/2 -.5 for 2339.5."
How do you lot mentally double and halve numbers?,"This is how I did it:

Doubling 4679: 4000 *2 is 8000, plus 1200 is 9200, plus 140 is 9340, and 18 is 9358.

Halving 6794: Half 6000 is 3000, plus 350 is 3350, half of 94 is 45+2 which is 47, so 3397.

Pretty much go from left to right. Though writing I would of course go right to left."
How do you lot mentally double and halve numbers?,"It's much easier to double or halve than you may realize because it's impossible to ever have a carry or remainder greater than 1.

Because of this, the easiest way to double is one digit at a time from right to left and the easiest way to halve is one digit at a time from left to right.

When doubling, simply double each digit, starting with the rightmost, and then add one to the result if the previous digit was 5 or greater, and write down the ones place of the result. Note that 4 * 2+1=9, and can never carry, but 5 * 2+0=10 and will always carry.

EXAMPLE:

854397463:

Double 3 +0 from (no prior digit) gives 6


Double 6 +0 from 3 = 12 (write 2)

Double 4 +1 from 6 = 9 (write 9)

Double 7 +0 from 4 = 14 (write 4)

Double 9 +1 from 7 = 19 (write 9)

Double 3 +1 from 6 = 7 (write 7)

Double 4 +0 from 3 = 8 (write 8)

Double 5 +0 from 4 = 10 (write 0)

Double 8 +1 from 5 = 17 (write 7)

Double 0 +1 from 8 = 1 (write 1)

1708794926

And to halve, go left to right noting you either add 10 to the current figure or don't depending on whether or not the previous halving was of an odd number creating a remainder...

(1+0)/2 = 0R1 (Write nothing or 0)

(7+10)/2 = 8R1 (Write 8)

(0+10)/2 = 5R0 (Write 5)

(8+0)/2 = 4R0 (Write 4)

(7+0)/2 = 3R1 (Write 3)

(9+10)/2 = 9R1 (Write 9)

(4+10)/2 = 7R0 (Write 7)

(9+0)/2 = 4R1 (Write 4)

(2+10)/2 = 6R0 (Write 6)

(6+0)/2 = 3R0 (Write 3)

How do you lot mentally double and halve numbers?,"For halving, I go left to right. Each digit on its own is automatic in my head, and I think of it “audibly” in my head, or out loud if someone is asking me. So I say three thousand and in the time that I say that I look at 7 and know that’s also 3, so I say three hundred. In that time I move to 9, which I know will be 4+5 from the seven so I say ninety, then I move to 4 and I know that’s 2+5 from the 9 so I say seven. 3397. 

For doubling it’s similar but I delay the audible part until I get through the two leftmost digits.
So for 4679 I see the 6 and know that 4 becomes 9, so I say 9000 and have 200 pending. I see seven and know it goes to 300 so I say 300 with 40 pending. I see 9 and know it goes to 50 so I say 50, 8 pending and 8 is the end so I say 8."

It took me seven months to relearn algebra 1 and 2, geometry, and trigonometry. I didn’t take pre calculus but it would have helped. Though I never took more than Algebra 2 in high school, my studying got me to pass the entrance exam enough to start calculus 1. 

In the last two years I’ve taken eight math classes, including calc 1-3 and differential equations, linear algebra, and discrete math. If I can do it, so can you.  You got this. 

PS: Calculus may not be easy, but it isn’t as daunting as one might think. If you know what a linear equation is and how to determine its slope, you already kind of understand what a derivative is. An integral is the opposite, and is used to figure out the area under a particular curve by summing up little rectangles."

Why do they define injective functions this way?,"a ≠ b => f(a) ≠ f(b) and f(a) = f(b) => a = b are equivalent by taking contrapositives. I don't know what kind of examples you are thinking of, but if you trace through the equivalence you will probably see why none of them work."
Why do they define injective functions this way?,"We don’t need that addition because the contrapositive of an implication is logically equivalent to the implication itself. So, if p=>q for some statements p and q, then the contrapositive (not q) => (not p) is the same statement in terms of its truth value.

Your definition at the end therefore says the same thing twice, so we only need that f(a)=f(b) => a=b to define an injective function."
Why do they define injective functions this way?,"I don’t think you understand what “implies” means in mathematics/logic. 

In this context, the statement

> “X implies Y”

means

> “X can only be true if Y is true.”

So when we say that a function f being injective is defined as

> f(a) = f(b) implies a = b,

we’re saying that (if f is injective)

> the only time you have f(a) = f(b) is when a = b. 

Does that help or have I misunderstood your problem?"
Why do they define injective functions this way?,"Well if a = b = 2b, then a and b must both be 0."
Why do they define injective functions this way?,">what if f(a)=f(b) implies some other thing too? like a=2b or a=b-π. 

Then that function ""f"" doesn't meet that condition. Only some functions meet this condition.

For instance, for the ""sin(x)"" function, sin(0)=sin(2pi), but 0 does *not* equal 2pi.  
Therefore, sin(x) doesn't meet the condition ""f(a)=f(b) => a=b""

However, for the function ""x+1"", it should be pretty clear that the same outputs require the same inputs, so ""f(a)=f(b) => a=b"" seems to hold."
Why do they define injective functions this way?,Contrapositive
Why do they define injective functions this way?,Imagine you had f(a) = f(b) and a = 2b. Well if a = 2b then a and b are different (unless they're both equal to 0). That means you've got f(a) = f(b) but different values for a and b. Two different values give the same function output. That's exactly what an injective function avoids!
What order should I learn stuff in?,Yes it is a bad idea

What order should I learn stuff in?,Don't do it.
What order should I learn stuff in?,"Usually, you can learn things in different orders. The trouble is if you start reading an explanation that expects you to know things you don't. You can learn Taylor series before integrals, but it has become traditional to learn them after so you can use integrals for a few things like integrating term by term, using integration by parts to estimate the remainder, and using the integral test for convergence. Often when doing theory you want to have certain theorems available, but for physics you don't care about theory. Algebra 2 should let you learn most of those topics if you fill in a few gaps along the way. If you want the safe route just work through a calculus book in order.

It is pretty common for more advanced students (say college upper classmen and above) to learn things in bits and pieces, but they have a good foundation. Even then working in a systematic way can help."
Is tenacity REALLY that much more important than aptitude?,"People have different talent levels, this is true. 

But you can’t do much about your talent level and you can do a lot about your persistence."
Is tenacity REALLY that much more important than aptitude?,"I'd say it is a bit mixed. If you don't have sufficient natural aptitude all the tenacity in the world just won't matter. The reverse is less true, if you have extreme aptitude just a little tenacity is sufficient to get through the classes. The grit is more important in forging into original work, where it is important to not give up when little initial progress is made. You really can't develop the habit of fortitude until you are challenged, this is one of the goals of university.

When I was in undergrad there was a fellow student who we called genius boy. He had been doing graduate level math at a very young age, until his parents put him back in Jr High for social reasons. We were physics majors, so math ability is very helpful. The physics was new for him and the math was slightly rusty as it had been many years since he did that. A homework set that we would spend 12hr on to get 1/2 done he would do the entire thing in an hour or two. He would take the homework to a bar and have a beer as he's working on it to see if he could get it done before getting too buzzed to do it. He called it racing the beer, it added to the challenge for him. 

On a few assignments we (my study group) tried studying with him. It turned out to be pointless, he was just on a very different level than we were. Even when he tried to explain things to us, it just didn't matter, we couldn't understand. I'm not weak at math, my Sr year in HS I placed 9th in the state math contest. But in the ocean there is always a bigger fish. Fast forward many years, we both had successful science careers. He had insights into Maxwell's equations that pushed electrodynamics forward. Mine, more pedestrian, but still interesting. For me my math ability was never the limiting factor, it was my English and writing ability.

Calc 2 can be brutal. I had a pretty easy time with it, but I think that relates to the class. My class had the goal of teaching calculus. My daughter who is also very strong in math was flunking calc 2 before she dropped it. She took a different version and got an A. She got A's in all her college math classes and graduated with honors. The Calc 2 she took was designed to weed people out and thin the herd. I looked at her problems and I thought they were completely unreasonable, I would have failed the class as well.

I'd say it is reasonable to see how your aptitude compares to your peers. For this you really need to work on a homework set together to get a sense where they are at."
Is tenacity REALLY that much more important than aptitude?,"Yes, tenacity is much more important. Most people can learn calculus with reasonable effort, but do nothing geniuses may struggle. At higher levels talent becomes more important. Not that Feilds Medalists don't work hard, but they need talent and luck as well."
Is tenacity REALLY that much more important than aptitude?,"for undergrad mostly yes, new discoveries no"
Is tenacity REALLY that much more important than aptitude?,"I believe that traditional talent is way, *way* rarer than people think. I think that 1/100 fantastic artists actually have any traditional talent, and I think it's the same for mathematicians, musicians, ect. 

I think there's a less traditional kind of talent, and that's the ""I draw a few hours almost everyday and never get burnt out from doing it."" talent that's more common. The ""I think of math in the shower, in the bathroom, talking to friends, ect."" talent. These people aren't ""naturally better,"" or have ""more intuition,"" but they have a disposition that'll lead to them getting further much, much faster. They also look like they have traditional talent, which makes people think it's more prevalent than it really is. This type of ""talent"" is also alot more accessible to normal people. 

Alot of people in my calc II class would consider me talented cause I'm having an easy time in the class; they think it just comes naturally to me or something. I'm not talented, I just spent months during the summer break getting ahead on the material. I have no job, no school club, no close relationships, so I have more time and I think it's fun. People who have ADHD/autism (me with ADHD) can sometimes hyper focus on stuff, and I did that with math and so I'm way ahead of others. It looks like I'm just magically better, but I'm just spending an abnormal amount of time on something and enjoying it while others don't, it's not talent, but it kinda looks like it is. 

My main point is that most people who are really, really good at stuff aren't talented, they're just weird. They have weird mindsets or behaviors that set them apart from others, but they aren't magically better. (usually) For example, Steph Curry is like clearly supernaturally talented, he has outlier skills that 99.999% of people *can't* mimic, but most NBA players are just gifted athletically and think way too much about basketball 24/7. They all *look* super talented (physically, most are) but skill wise only a few could be considered completely outside the curve. Terrance Tao is probably supernaturally talented, but most of your professors aren't, they're probably just a little weird."

If that's the case, you might need to adjust your learning strategy. Often it's just a matter of asking questions more frequently, going to office hours, and talking to people who can help you. It can be inefficient to go about learning things all by yourself."

Is tenacity REALLY that much more important than aptitude?,"I think I can confidently say that everything you need to do to get a math major can be done with tenacity and even a thimble full of natural aptitude. The difficulty varies more with the quality of instruction than it does with personal talent.

That is the real tough but to crack. If you're not getting the instruction you need it can be excedingly difficult. The good news is there are far more resources available now then at any other time to find alternative explainers (YouTube).

After that, if you plan to go into research or independent study, that's when you really need some ideas or genius to get to ""success"". At least that's my takeaway after trying for 18 months and proving/discovering a lot of things that no one was interested in because they were too obvious."
Is tenacity REALLY that much more important than aptitude?,"Being talented helps. Being persistent is more important. Being curious and genuinely interested probably matters most.

If you're genuinely curious about the subject you're learning, even if you aren't particularly gifted, you'll usually get there. Persistence can also get you there, but being persistent with a subject that doesn't interest you takes a lot more willpower."
Is tenacity REALLY that much more important than aptitude?,"Oh, Taylor Expansions are a joy. :) I would say tenacity definitely is a big help, especially once you leave school. My biggest work accomplishments were from tenacity, not aptitude, and I feel like that probably goes for a lot of people. I would expand on tenacity to focus on “undauntedness”, though. Tenacity is valuable, but conquering your personal fears of trying something new and difficult (and potentially failing) is probably the most valuable thing you can have there. I think Calc 2 is a good primer for that. It is important that you try new things and fail them, as that is how you build aptitude and experience."
Is tenacity REALLY that much more important than aptitude?,"""Talent"" is a lie made up by people who want to make themselves feel good about quitting.  It doesn't exist.

There's more to learning than *just* tenacity; good teachers make a big difference, as does learning to approach material the right way.  But tenacity will get you most of the way there.

I got a D the first time I took Calculus II, then re-took it with a different professor and got an A.

It's been 25 years since I graduated, and there have been plenty of times I've run into problems where I felt like they were impossible and I'd never figure them out, but it has always only been a matter of keeping at it until I found the right approach."
Bottom-top approach in math textbooks,"Math isn’t always taught this way.

I teach probability both to graduate students and undergraduates , and how I present the same material depends on the audience.

It’s true that most math textbooks are written for math majors, so there’s often less motivation at the beginning other than just general abstract interest."
Bottom-top approach in math textbooks,"Personally, for me, I prefer textbook presentations that you describe as using a bottom-top approach as I, personally, don't get invested emotionally in random pet problems people are trying to solve if they are not physically there or if I am not watching a video of them, or a lecturer with a penchant for storytelling, nerding out and conveying their enthusiasm and obsession with the search for a solution in a way that actually lands for me. In a seminar talk, yes, yap away to get people excited and interested, sure, but in a textbook? Let's get on with it and circle back with a ""Now, we can prove this. Surprise!""

I can definitely get secondhand invested, however, if someone has beautiful writing and does character development and there's a cohesive theme, and it all becomes an immersive novel with tension and such, but to me, that's superfluous if what comes right after is the usual drudgery of teaching myself something from scratch using a book. I would rather have a solid understanding of the conceptual frameworks that will be needed first than ""motivation."" I don't need a carrot if I still need to jump through another thousand silly hoops anyway; I want to know how high I need to jump to clear the dumb hoops and be done with it.

Also, math and abstraction have their own inherent beauty to me, personally, and applications are cool as they arise and those connections are made, but if I am learning a bunch of sophisticated mathematical machinery, I want to get that down solid first, memorized, and explained in a concise way with lots of examples tying it to concepts I already understand well enough before studying the main motivating application, which is merely a muse that is being put on a pedestal as I still need to grind out practice problems for preliminary concepts. 

For instance, in undergraduate abstract algebra, I preferred formally learning group theory, ring theory, field theory, and Galois theory before we ever discussed the insolvability of the general quintic equation. For me, it was a bonus in the ""Nice! That's good to know."" Had the whole semester been referencing that constantly and building up to that final achievement in Gallian's book, I would have rolled my eyes and resented it because I would have had too many other things on my plate. ""Literally, I don't care about that. I need to pay bills working as a bartender and tutor, one of my parents is terminally ill, senior theses are a nightmare, and there's so much else going on that I have no room for this author to make a big deal about these equations for 4 months straight.""

Then again, it also depends on presentation style, and the author may be a great conversationalist and can weave together interesting narratives and stories in a way that is immersive. I don't typically encounter that in standard math and physics textbooks I have read during my undergraduate and graduate studies, though. As such, the theorem/proof/example model is usually preferable for me. 

Ultimately, it's a matter of taste and preference."
Bottom-top approach in math textbooks,"1. Bottom-up is just the more efficient way to learn something (it's also easier to teach). You learn the rules first, then you apply them. Long-term, it's always easier to go from general to specific. Having brief overview can help you remember the ideas, but intuition doesn't help you *do* things mechanically. Physics and stats texts always frustrate me because there is so much fluffy exposition before letting you get your hands dirty. And when I tutor physics students bottom-up, they are suddenly able to do the problems they couldn't when their physics prof just told them about cool intuition tricks. Most of them still can't do basic algebra. In my experience, people who clamor for a top-down approach don't realize they've already learned a lot of the bottom intuition, or they are people who are not serious about learning the substance. Intuition comes from experience, not authority. (Also, do you want your physics classes catered to mathematicians? Why should it go the other way?)
2. I've never had a math book or teacher that didn't give the motivation first. Maybe it's just briefer than you want, but it's largely fluff and students can think about it later if they want. You are just wrong about your conclusion how mathematicians think. Also students get angry with you if you ""waste"" their time with stuff that won't be on the test, and math majors want to get to the meat anyway. 
3. Applied math courses take an approach more like what you're saying, but a theory class will be about theory. 
4. You probably underestimate how much physics intuition just by being alive. You can learn a lot just by tossing a ball at a wall. In math, you have the extra burden of being the computer/universe/simulator, so you have to master the rules before you can do experiments."
Bottom-top approach in math textbooks,"> mathematicians seem to first develop some basic definitions,state some axioms and other immediate lemmas/theorems are then built on them,and math textbooks use a similar format, but honestly this kind of a definitions-propositions-lemmas/theorem-corollary formal troubles me a little as a physics student when I sit down to read math textbooks and the reason is pretty simple...it looks highly unmotivated at first. 

This is a reasonable thing to say based on how mathematicians write books and talk about our subject.  But this is not psychologically or historically how mathematics is actually developed.

Math is usually developed from a high-level idea or question, and lower-level tools and objects are constructed to answer the question.  This is mostly the same as in physics.  

However, after the discovery has been made, mathematicians organize the new information into textbooks.  Textbooks are usually praised for their ""efficiency"", especially among other mathematicians who already understand the subject.  Books are most efficient when they cut out the discovery process and get straight to the pure logical flow from definition to proof.

I think this makes textbooks very bad for students learning the subject, but it makes them great as reference texts.  Since textbooks are mostly reference texts and not pedagogical texts, then the pedagogy is usually filled in by the professor.  Obviously the quality of that depends on the professor.  

In fact, I think the same thing happens -- maybe to a slightly lesser degree -- in physics.  I find physics texts for upper-level physics, completely unreadable for mostly the same reason."

Help with basic!,"When solving problems of this kind, there are usually two important steps. First, convert the plain-language statement of the problem into an equation, and second, solve the equation to find the important unknowns.

how to solve this recurrence relation?,"I doubt that there is a unique solution to the recurrence since there isn’t for the gamma function recurrence.

Edit: Here's a graph for a solution defined on [0,4). You can continue it as far as you like. 

https://www.desmos.com/calculator/wjw1ww9k2a"
how to solve this recurrence relation?,"We have f(n+1)/(n+1)! = ((n+1) f(n) + 1) / (n+1)! = f(n) / n! + 1/(n+1)! and hence f(n+1)/(n+1)! - f(n)/n! = 1/(n+1)!.

Consider the exponential generating function F(x) = sum_{n=0}^(inf) f(n)/n! x^(n). From the above recurrence we obtain that (F(x) - f(0)) - x F(x) = sum_{n=0}^(inf) 1/n! x^(n) - 1 = exp(x) - 1 and hence F(x) = (exp(x) + f(0)) / (1-x).

We have exp(x) 1/(1-x) = (sum_{n=0}^(inf) x^(n)/n!) (sum_{n=0}^(inf) x^(n)) = sum_{n=0}^(inf) c(n) with c(n) = sum_{i=0}^(n) x^(i)/i! x^(n-i) = x^(n) sum_{i=0}^(n) 1/i! = x^(n) e 𝛤(n+1,1)/n! [where the last equality is by computer algebra].

Hence exp(x) 1/(1-x) = sum_{n=0}^(inf) e 𝛤(n+1,1) x^(n)/n!.

And of course f(0) / (1-x) = sum_{n=0}^(inf) f(0)n! x^(n)/n!. Hence F(x) = sum_{n=0}^(inf) (f(0)n! + e 𝛤(n+1,1)) x^(n)/n! and f(n) = f(0)n! + e 𝛤(n+1,1) = f(0)𝛤(n+1) + e 𝛤(n+1,1).

Plugging in 0 yields f(0) = f(0) 𝛤(1) + e 𝛤(1,1) = f(0) + e exp(-1) = 1 f(0) + 1 = 1 f(0) + 1 so that the solution is indeed consistent with the recursion at 0.



So to obtain the solution you ""only"" have to prove that the sum of the inverse factorials up to n is e 𝛤(n+1,1)/n! - which follows from some formula on wikipedia (see ""Special Values""). See formula (2) here https://mathworld.wolfram.com/IncompleteGammaFunction.html."
A very fundamental thing about proportions I seem to not understand well,"‘Adding something to both sides of a ratio’ is a bit of a weird thing to do, so it’s tricky to come up with an intuition for what’s going on here. Here’s one way to think about it though:

Think of those ratios as vectors. Or, if you’re not familiar with vectors, think of them as coordinates of points, with a line from the origin to the point. 

Instead of 5:2, we have the vector (2,5); instead of 10:4, we have the vector (4,10). 

These two vectors - the two lines to those points - point in exactly the same direction, but one of them is twice as long as the other. 

The fact they point in the same direction is because their slopes are identical - 5/2 is equal to 10/4. They represent equal ratios.

Multiplying both components of a vector by the same number only changes its length but not its slope - 2 \* (2,5) = (4,10)

Now, if you add five to each part of the shorter vector, that’s like adding (5,5) to (2,5). That gives us (7,10). 

If you’ve ever added vectors by lining them up end to end you might picture this as drawing an arrow up five and across five from (2,5) ending at (7,10), then drawing a new arrow from the origin to (7,10) to represent the sum of those two vectors, forming a sort of triangle. 

It shouldn’t be too surprising that if you do the same process from (4,10) but adding a vector twice as big - (10,10) - you’re just drawing the same triangle at twice the size, so you end up at (14,20) - a point that’s on the same line as we ended up on the small triangle, but twice as far from the origin. We add 2 times one vector to two times another vector, we end up at two times the sum of the original vectors. That is, a vector with the same slope. 

In vector terms, you first did (2,5) + (5,5) = (7,10)

Then you solved (4,10) + (10,10) and got (14,20), and you’re asking whether there’s a reason why

2 \* (2,5) + 2 \* (5,5) = 2 \* (7,10)

And the reason is because scalar multiplication is distributive over vectors. 

nA + nB = n(A + B)

And scalar multiplication of vectors preserves their slope. "
A very fundamental thing about proportions I seem to not understand well,"I believe this is because a ratio is a division relationship, so we can divide or multiply the numerator and denominator by a number to maintain the proportions, however, adding/subtracting from top and bottom changes the fraction entirely, because you aren’t acknowledging the fact that any ratio is technically division. 

Someone feel free to correct me if any of this sounds wrong, but that’s been my impression of it."
A very fundamental thing about proportions I seem to not understand well,"It essentially boils down to your operation being multiplication, not addition. In your 5/2 and 10/4 case, what you are actually doing is multiplying the top by 2 and the bottom by 3.5. As you conduct the same multiplication on each of the porportions, the results will remain porportionate, however as this multiplication is not 1 (its 2/3.5) they will not be porportionate to the origional fractions. 

The reason this happens appears when you break it down into two steps, shown below:

5/2 + 5/2 = 10/2 (Add 5 to the top)

10/2 * 1/3.5 = 10/7 (Add 5 to the bottom)

You cannot actually add 5 to the dominator while keeping it as a fraction. The only basic operations which will change it are multiplication (shown) and division. By ""adding"" 5 the actual operation preformed on the fraction is multiplying by 1/3.5. The first addition could have also been done by simply multiplying by 2, as we just add it to itself. This is where the 2/3.5 ratio origionates. 

Remember that porportions are just fractions, and any operation you preform on them connects back to an operation you could preform on a fraction."
A very fundamental thing about proportions I seem to not understand well,"You have 5/2 = (2*5)/(2*2) as a start. Then you did (5+5)/(2+5) and (2*5+2*5)/(2*2+2*5). Now for the second quantity, you can pull out the factor 2 and you have 2*(5+5)/2*(2+5) = (5+5)/(2+5). Of course, (5+5)/(2+5) is not equal to 5/2, which also answers your second question. It is more fun to now substitute variables for your numbers and see that these relationships are generally true."
A very fundamental thing about proportions I seem to not understand well,"In more general terms, we know (a/b) = (k\*a)/(k\*b)  
Let's say we add x to the LHS and k\*x to the RHS to both numerator and denominator  
(a + x)/(b + x) = (k\*a + k\*x)/(k\*b + k\*x)  
(a + x)/(b + x) = (k\*(a + x)) / (k\*(b + x) )

substituting a' = a+x, b' = b+x, we get  
(a'/b') = (k\*a')/(k\*b') which was part of our original statement, and is therefore also true

When we just add some x without the multiplier, we get  
(a + x)/(b + x) = (k\*a + x)/(k\*b + x)  
(a + x)\*(k\*b + x) = (k\*a + x) \* (b + x)      ...(multiplying both sides)  
a\*k\*b + a\*x + x\*k\*b + x\^2 = k\*a\*b + k\*a\*x + x\*b + x\^2  ...(expanding)  
a\*x + x\*k\*b = k\*a\*x + x\*b ...(subtracting both sides)  
a\*x + x\*k\*b - k\*a\*x - x\*b = 0  ...(finding solutions for 0)  
x \* ( 1 - k) \* (a - b) = 0 ...(factoring)

So you'll see that the only valid solutions are when x = 0 (nothing added), k = 1 (ratio maintained e.g. (a + x)/(b + x) = (a + x)/(b + x)), and a = b (we have a fraction in the form (x + a) / (x + a))"
A very fundamental thing about proportions I seem to not understand well,"Think about the general case, using variables. What you are noticing is that (a+x)/(b+x) = (ca + cx)/(cb + cx) since the right hand side of that equation is (c/c) * (a+x)/(b+x). 

You are also noticing that (a+x)/(b+x) is not the same as a/b. Try to reframe your mindset. Instead of asking “why is this not true”, try to recognize that you just showed it’s not true, and think about why you would assume it to be true in the first place. This sounds circular, but these two fractions are different because they’re different. If you want some closure, if you add x to the numerator of a/b, try finding what you would need to add to the denominator of a/b to keep the proportion the same."
A very fundamental thing about proportions I seem to not understand well,"You have some rational number where p, q are integers:

    p/q = (2p)/(2q) = (2/2)p/q

Now you're taking some parameter a and adding it to p and q:

    (p + a)/(q + a) = (2/2)(p + a)/(q + a)

Why are these still proportionate? You can easily see why, if you reduce the 2/2, they are still the same.

Another question is does the value change, i.e., is `p/q = (p + a)/(q + a)`? You can easily see that this is not the case, since if you take the limit of the right side as `a → ∞` that p and q become negligible on the right side and you just end up with `a/a = 1`. Therefore `p/q` where `p ≠ q` cannot be equal to `(p + a)/(q + a)` for any `a` except `a = 0`."

>haha, I feel like I've made this exact same comment at least 3 times in the past couple days. That Veritasium video must've got a lot of view.

>Yeah, saying one infinite set is the same size or is bigger than another can seem silly, because *the traditional concept of ""size"" as such becomes meaningless when applied to infinities*. That's why the precise defined property of ""Cardinality"" was created. Its a way that describes finite sets in a way similar to how we'd use words like ""size"", but it also can be applied to infinite sets without being inconsistent. And this way of applying it to infinities doesn't necessarily have to abide by our intuitions relating to sizes of finite things, because, if it did, it too would be meaningless and inconsistent when applied to infinities.

>Think of it like the [Gamma Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function) that takes our idea of ""factorial"", which only can be applied to natural numbers, and extends it to all real numbers. One thing you might notice about factorial, is that for any natural number x>y, x!>y!. This might seem like something absolutely intrinsic to the factorial function. But, for whatever reason, we want to try to see what 0.25! would be like if there was something similar to factorial but could work on rational numbers. So we have the gamma function, and to our surprise, 0.25! is greater than 1!. It turns out, then when you extend something like that into a larger domain, some intuition you might associate with the original one goes right out the window.

To answer the question, we have to make statements about all possible programs, of which there are infinite. And once we're talking about infinite things, it is VERY useful to be able to recognize which infinite things are countable and which aren't.

Can you guys help me with this logic?,"Why do you say enumeration or listing don't map to physical reality?  Isn't this kind of the basis for even the most basic arithmetic?  

I also think reliance on precise definitions is a good thing, otherwise you end up using colloquial terms like 'access' or 'traverse' that give certain intuition but are vague."
Can you guys help me with this logic?,"We don't know whether there are any physical infinities. We have various models that have infinite things in them, but that part of the model might be wrong. 

For example, we don't know if the universe is flat and boundless, or not. We don't know if black holes are true singularities or not. We don't know if space is quantized or not.

Certainly, in some contexts, it matters whether something is infinite but does not matter which infinity it is. But in some contexts, that matters too.

Enumeration or listing seems to me like it *very obviously* corresponds to something in physical reality, you know, like lists. I'm not sure why you consider this particular thing too abstract."
Can you guys help me with this logic?,"> Are there mathematical infinites in our universe?

Can you guys help me with this logic?,"*> The mathematical claim that uncountable infinity is “larger” is only true within the abstract framework of set theory*

The mathematical claim that one number is ""larger"" than another is only true within the abstract framework of arithmetic.

Which FYI in modern mathematics is understood entirely in terms of that exact same ""abstract framework of"" set theory you mention.

Mathematics is ALL abstraction.

Don't make the mistake of assuming that it isn't - or that some part of it that you are complete comfortable with and haven't closely examined or thought through is completely concrete and non-abstract, while something new and uncomfortable that you don't understand yet is ""all abstract and therefore, meaningless"".

It is ALL abstract.

Can you guys help me with this logic?,"I'm going to frame challenge and claim that the difference between countable and uncountable infinity does make a difference in a real-world relevant way. If something is countably infinite, we could, at least in principle, enumerate all the elements. If there's a particular element we're interested in, we can go down the list one by one and we'll get to it eventually. For uncountable sets, we know for sure that we can never do that. So the distinction between countable infinites and larger ones says something qualitative and structural that can often be relevant outside the realm of abstract mathematics."
Can you guys help me with this logic?,"You are confused. Never assume that some definition in mathematics has anything to do with physics. There is no ”scaffolding”. 

If you want to know what is ”infinity” in physics, please talk to cosmologists and theoretical physicists.

If you want to know what different kind of mathematical objects mathematicians think are ”infinite”, and how some infinites are bigger than others, please ask mathematicians. 

In mathematics you have many kinds of infinite sets (or similar objects winkwink), which are different sizes in a very precise logical sense.

If a mathematician says some set is bigger than continuum, it is not a physical statement."
Can you guys help me with this logic?,"If there were only four particles in the universe, then you could say that ""in practice"" 100 and a trillion are just as large ""because in both cases, you can never fully access or traverse the entirety of either."" However, 100 and a trillion are different, and 100 is almost nothing compared to a trillion.

In the same way, the contents of the physical universe are irrelevant to the fact that countable infinity is pretty much zero compared to the first uncountable infinity (and the first uncountable infinity is pretty much zero compared to the next uncountable infinity, and so on)."
Can you guys help me with this logic?,"Best example I can give you is the electron density function. We need only assume two things:

1. The exact position of an electron moves continuously, and is thus best represented as real numbers instead of jumping from discrete positions instantaneously.

2. The exact position of an electron is not known in general, but instead a probabilistic distribution, often called the electron cloud.

With this, we can look at a standard lone hydrogen atom, and conclude that there are infinitely many possible positions that its lone electron could be found. In fact, since we believe that the exact position is a real number, we can conclude that there  are more positions than we could count, even given infinite time.

From a practical standpoint, computers don't really work below a certain precision, and we don't have infinite time. So we can't practically work with uncountable infinities yet. If we ever got a true working quantum computer that worked as a nondeterministic Turing machine, we could invent a new school of probabilistic computing for which uncountable infinities may have practical use."
Can you guys help me with this logic?,"Let's say you have 3 apples, now I ask you how many ways there are to select any number of them.

If you believe that there is a countable infinite amount of stars, then I can ask you again, how many ways are there to select any number of them?   
The answer is infinite, uncountably so.

This infinite is in no way less real than the one we started with. You could say that we're not counting physical objects anymore but... we are! The number of ways we can pick from a set of things is in no way less physical that the number of things that we have in the first place."

Serious: should I further learn math? Should I formally study it?,"Funny enough, I'm actually in the same boat.  I am considering going for a masters in statistics because I enjoy learning about the aspects of probability, randomness, and data analysis.  

The only issue is that the highest math I've taken in college is Calc I, mostly because I was too afraid to fully commit! 

Now, working at my day job, longing for something different, I am still getting that itch to study the language of the universe.

Serious: should I further learn math? Should I formally study it?,"advanced math is of less and less use the more advanced it gets unless your job (or some hobby) demands it of you.  Unclear where you are in life, but are you IN college?  If so, then consider the applied math degrees, which are most forms of engineering, some types of computer science, etc.   Then you have a use for what you learn, but its not a pure math degree.   Pure math is useful too; jobs like actuary use it but you can also be the math guy backing up engineers.  We had about 5 aerospace engineers and 1 pure math guy who could take some of their load off or double check their work at my first job.

If you are outside of the degree choice / career choice part of your life, then decide if you either want to make this a hobby or have some use for the knowledge.   I have a math minor, and I use maybe 30% of what I used to know, and forgot a lot of the rest...  it slips away if unused, and day to day there isn't a lot of use for 3d calculus or differential equations or eigenvectors.  Nothing wrong with math for fun, but that part of the question you must decide for yourself."
Serious: should I further learn math? Should I formally study it?,">most often its stuff that is interesting but has no use that I know of

How do you know this if you haven't formally studied mathematics? You would be surprised by the sheer applicability of mathematics. I also thought math was pointless once upon a time, but a single calculus class completely changed my perspective on it.

So when you say that math isn't applicable, what you probably mean to say is that math isn't *currently* applicable to you*.* That is, there are types of problems that can be approached with mathematics that you don't even currently realize exist because you have little or no training in the subject*.* It could be that upon receiving training, you will come to realize how useful mathematics is once you're more familiar with it."
Serious: should I further learn math? Should I formally study it?,"I don't know what your career is right now, but i don't think going for a math degree is the best if that's your situation. I am studying physics at uni and the math you use is very strong and you constantly have to use it in real (or approximately real) problems. I love math and I actually don't believe every result we get if I don't understand the math behind it.

So as someone said in another comment, maybe a masters degree in math in some area that you can use in your job/other career is a good idea. Or maybe you can find another career like physics or some engineering degree where you can learn a lot of math and actually use it.

But also maybe you just enjoy knowing math things as a hobby. I love music and playing instruments but I never thought about doing a career in something related because I want it to be my hobby, a thing to enjoy that's not a responsibility. So maybe think about what role math has in your life and think about how you want to enjoy it too. 

Random story: 
The other day in a statistics class, our professor told us about a problem that appears when you extend the idea of probability to an infinite set of possible results, but the real problem was that you can't find in the real world a situation like this. It's true that there are problems with using the theory in these situations, but that just doesn't happen in real life, so his conclusion was that mathematicians are quite creative and sometimes they create problems that nobody has.

 If you don't care about super abstract ideas, look up something where you use math, instead of where you just learn it."

[Statistics] Simpson's Paradox: Is guesswork the only way? Please help...,"Well, the general way Simpson's paradox works is that, while statistic A1 is better than B1, and A2 better than B2, one of these halves is worse than the other, and the worse one is dominant in A's overall statistics, while the better one is dominant in B's.

For a simple example, putting them in terms of hits:misses, the first halves could be 201:200 for A and 10:10 for B, while the second half is 11:1 for A and 200:20 for B. 

A is slightly higher in each, with the statistics in each half being roughly 1:1 for the first half and 10:1 for the second, but A's stats are dominated by the second (total 212:201 being closer to 1:1) while B's are mainly the first (total 210:30 closer to 10:1), making B's results better."
[Statistics] Simpson's Paradox: Is guesswork the only way? Please help...,"Counter examples are good. Although they can be guesswork they can often be thought out logically. I think there are two (relatively) easy ways through Simpson's Paradox.

1. Discard the averages and go back to the raw data: Simpson's Paradox disappears.
2. If raw data is unavailable look at the most extreme edge case you can muster. 

If seasons are two halves of ten games then the most extreme case is that Player A played 1 game in the higher scoring half of the season and all 10 in the low scoring half. Player 2 played all ten in the high scoring half and only one in the low scoring half. 

Assuming that (batting average)=(total score)/(matches played) you now have the information to construct the most skewed version of Player A and Player B's average score and can see if B is able to beat A on the average.

But... typically Simpson's Paradox is not an exercise in finding edge cases like this. It is simply a warning that averages of averages are meaningless and that you need to go back to the raw data when you do something new."
[Statistics] Simpson's Paradox: Is guesswork the only way? Please help...,"It isn't guesswork, the point of the ""paradox"" is to teach the student :  

a) that averages conceals frequencies. ie an average of 10/day doesn't inform you how many days this average was taken over.

b) the sum of 2 population's average isn't the average of the averages. ie if one average is 10 and the other is 20, it doesn't mean that the average of the total is 15. In fact, it can be anything between 10 and 20. Hence if you have 2 teams over two periods, as long as the range of their averages overlap you cannot conclude that one has a higher or lower total average.

functional equation,"You can solve this using generating functions:
Write F(x) = sum_{n=0}^(inf) f(n)/n! x^(n) i.e. F is the exponential generating function of f. You have f(n+1) = n! + (n+1)f(n). Now multiply both sides by x^(n+1)/(n+1)! to obtain

f(n+1)/(n+1)! x^(n+1) = n!/(n+1)! x^(n+1) + (n+1)/(n+1)! f(n) x^(n+1) = 1/(n+1) x^(n+1) + f(n)/n! x^(n+1)

Now sum from n=0 to infinity. On the left hand side:

sum_{n=0}^(inf) f(n+1)/(n+1)! x^(n+1) = sum_{n=1}^(inf) f(n)/(n)! x^(n) = 
sum_{n=0}^(inf) f(n)/n! x^(n) - f(0)/0! x^(0) = F(x) - f(0)

On the right hand side the left term:

sum_{n=0}^(inf) 1/(n+1) x^(n+1) = sum_{n=1}^(inf) 1/n x^(n) = -log(1-x)

(rewriting this with the log isn't really necessary as well reverse this later on, but it makes the intermediate steps easier to follow)
The right term becomes:

sum_{n=0}^(inf) f(n)/n! x^(n+1) = x sum_{n=0}^(inf) f(n)/n! x^(n) = x F(x)

So all in all we have that **F(x) - f(0) = x F(x) - log(1-x)**.
We can now solve this for F(x):

F(x) (1-x) = f(0) - log(1-x)   <=>    F(x) = (f(0) - log(1-x))/(1-x) =  f(0) 1/(1-x) +  (-log(1-x)) * 1/(1-x)

The idea is now to rewrite this function as an exponential series in the way that we originally did to define F, then the coefficients in that series will be be precisely the values of f we want.

We first use that -log(1-x) = sum_{n=1}^(inf) x^(n)/n and 1/(1-x) = sum_{n=0}^(inf) x^(n) so that f(0) 1/(1-x) = sum_{n=0}^(inf) x^(n) f(0) = sum_{n=0}^(inf) f(0)n! / n! x^(n) and (-log(1-x)) 1/(1-x) = (sum_{n=1}^(inf) x^(n)/n) (sum_{m=0}^(inf) x^(m)). This is a so-called Cauchy-product, and there's a general formula for those. We have

(sum_{n=0}^(inf) x^(n+1)/(n+1)) (sum_{m=0}^(inf) x^(m)) = 
sum_{k=0}^(inf) c_k with c_k = sum_{l=0}^(k) x^(l+1)/(l+1) x^(k-l) = x^(k+1) sum_{l=0}^(k) 1/(l+1) = x^(k+1) sum_{l=1}^(k+1) 1/l = x^(k+1) H(k+1) where H(k) is the k-th harmonic number.

So the product is sum_{k=0}^(inf) x^(k+1) H(k+1) = sum_{k=1}^(inf) x^(k) H(k) and hence in total

F(x) = f(0) + sum_{n=1}^(inf) (f(0)n! + H(n)n!) / n! x^(n)

so that f(n) = (f(0) + H(n)) n! for n >= 1"

What is the difference btw inverse and reciprocal trigno functions?,"They are not at all both (sinx)^(-1). arcsin is the inverse function of sin, which means arcsin(sin(x)) = x = sin(arcsin(x)) (when -pi/2 < x < pi/2), whilst cosec is the multiplicative inverse, also called reciprocal, of sin. This means 1/sin(x) = cosec(x) and 1/cosec(x) = sin(x) (for all x such that sin(x) is nonzero).

Edit: you can write arcsin(x) = sin^(-1)(x) and coesc(x) = (sin(x))^(-1), but these don't mean the same thing, and personally I always avoid this notation for precisely the reason that it can be confusing to people."
What is the difference btw inverse and reciprocal trigno functions?,"It is an unfortunate notation that the inverse function often uses a superscript. of negative one. You see how I am careful not to use the word exponent. Because it is not an exponent. “Arc sine“ means “I am thinking of the sine of an angle. Can you tell me what the angle is?“ in other words, if this speaker told you 1/2, you would tell them the angle they are thinking of is 30°.

The cosecant of an angle is the reciprocal of the sine of that angle. In other words, the cosecant of 30° is two.

It’s important to understand that the argument of trig functions is an angle. Whether the angle is expressed in degrees or radians is a side issue. When I say, sine (theta) or sine (x), I am taking the sine of an angle, which ultimately is a ratio, in this case of the opposite side over the hypotenuse. 

When I ask for the inverse function, arc sine, for example, I already know the ratio, and I am looking for the original angle. 

In the very old days, before calculators were common, there would be a printed book of all of the trig numbers accurate to about 1/10 of a degree of the angle. So you would have a list of angles in the first column, and then the second column you would have the sine of that angle. The arc sine problem would have you look at the sine column, find the closest number, and then look to the left to see the original angle."
What is the difference btw inverse and reciprocal trigno functions?,"Sin^(-1)(x) this is the inverse sine function aka arcsine  this is the operation the 'undoes' the sine arcsin(x)

Sin^(-1)(x) = arcsin(x)


(Sin(x))^(-1) This is the reciprocal of the sine function a.k.a cosecant function

(Sin(x))^(-1) = Csc(x)

Note that the Cosecant is the is the ""multiplicative inverse"" of the sine, and that happens to be rasing a value to the -1 power.

Also our inverse function notation is f^(-1)(x) so the notation for the inverse trig functions is consistent with how we normally work it.

For this reason I prefer to represent sine squared as (Sin(x))^(2) instead of Sin^(2)(x) because this removes the ambiguity by being consistent with exponent notation of (Sin(x))^(-1)"
What is the difference btw inverse and reciprocal trigno functions?,"the reciprocal of anything is just 1/anything.  That is what is.  This can be written as an exponent: (anything)\^-1.

the inverse is something else entirely.  If you have two functions, f(x) and g(x), then the answer when you perform one on the other **must be** x.   So f(g(x)) = x is an inverse relationship.  Eg x\*x and square root of x.  The square root of x\*x is x!   However, 1/x\*x is not x unless x is 1 or -1.  If x is simply 2, its 1/4.  1/4 does not = 2.

trig functions have all sorts of unique properties and it can get confusing.  You have to remember what they are at all times or none of it will make any sense at all.  The sine of an angle is the opposite length / hypotenuse.   The inverse sine of that value is the angle; in this sense, the angle is your X from what I said above.  So if you have the distances but not the angle, you can get the angle with the inverse trig function.  And as you know from beginner trig, if you have the angle and the hypotenuse, you can get the other side with sin or cos or tan, etc.  If you ever get your head spinning, it may help if you just memorize an anchor point for it all, and a good one is that tan(x) is the slope of the hypotenuse (opposite/adjacent == rise/run!).  

Its bad jargon, but you MUST memorize that sin\^-1(x) is NOT 1/sin(x).  That would be written sin(x)\^-1.   The difference is small, but if you mess it up, you will have the wrong answer from the first step."
is -0 just 100%/infinity?,"There's a lot of...weird notational choices here. Firstly, -0 is redudant as -0 = 0, but cool. Then, 100% is just 1. Finally, and the most problematic, infinity. Infinity isn't a number (at least not in the real numbers, which is what we generally use).

If all of this is boiling down to asking whether 1/infinity = 0, then no, because infinity, as mentioned, isn't a number. But yes, if you take the limit of 1/x as x goes to infinity, then 1/x goes to 0. That is probably what you're looking for."

    |C u H|  =  |C| + |H| - |C n H|  =  C(18;5) + C(18;5) - C(12;5)

Combining all results, the number of hands with (at least) on club and one heart is

    |C' n H'|  =  C(24;5) - 2*C(18;5) + C(12;5)  =  26160

"[integration] very confused on how they got the opposite signs to me, can someone please explain?","It looks like you did a u-substitution to integrate sin(-2x), so let's let u = -2x. Then du = -2 dx or dx = (-1/2) du

integral sin(-2x) dx = (-1/2) integral sin(u) du = -(1/2) \[-cos(u)\] = (1/2) cos(-2x). 

Also cos(-2x) = cos(2x), so this is equivalent to (1/2) cos(2x) as the answer shows.

Second term: Let u = 8x, du = 8dx, dx = (1/8)du

Then integral sin(8x)dx = (1/8) integral sin(u) du = -(1/8) cos(8x)

Without seeing your work, it's impossible to know where you made the sign error, but I'm guessing that you forgot that the integral of sin(x) is -cos(x)."

You can improve the Elo system with a confidence, but I've never actually followed the math on this. In theory the entire thing is just a Bayesian update of a rating probability distribution after each match, but I have a feeling this isn't how it's done and the math won't work out very well."

How to get good at algebra,Practice. Lots of practice.
How to get good at algebra,"It often comes down to having rock-solid foundations. That means being completely at home with things like fractions, negatives, and all things arithmetic. If those aren’t automatic yet, it’s really worth going back and drilling them.

A lot of students try to just memorize rules or tricks, but as one of my teachers put it, “that’s like building a castle on sand” - it might work for a while, but it’ll collapse under anything complex.

Algebra is really just arithmetic with unknowns. If you’re totally comfortable simplifying something like 3 × (4 – 7/2) + 5, then doing the same steps but with an “x” in there becomes a lot easier.

My best tip: practice manipulating expressions with actual numbers first, then swap in variables once you’re confident. And don’t rush - fluency takes time. But it will come."
How to get good at algebra,"Sorry, I accidentally deleted my post. My Reddit app has been behaving strangely since the last update.

There are lots of techniques that can help you learn and perform more effectively.

I also had a terrible time in math classes in both high school and as an undergraduate, and yet today, after 30 years of teaching, I'm a retired math professor.

The thing that completely changed math for me was learning how to properly read a math textbook so that I could apply my talents for reading and writing to math.

In graduate school I suddenly found myself getting all A's and B's in my math courses while actually spending less time studying than I had as an undergraduate to get F's and C's.

Here's a short collection of simple strategies that I wrote years ago with another professor. It includes the methodology that I used to read textbooks.

[Math Study Skills Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BLme5o6AQ3i2m5nK76QJcBPZzH5NDV19g4wlkHNS53A)

It's a Google doc so it might look odd in a browser. It's best viewed in an app designed specifically for Google docs.

Don't try to implement them all at once. 😄

Try a couple at a time to see if those work for you.

If a technique doesn't seem to work, then replace it with a new one.

If it is working for you, keep practicing it until it becomes part of your routine and then try adding another one.

I hope that it helps. 😀"

What’s the best method to improve arithmetic,"As others have said, practice is key. This doesn’t necessarily mean just sitting at a table and powering through scores of problems. When you’re about and about, you will see numbers everywhere, on license plates for example. Play with those numbers: add them up, multiply one digit by another, etc. The more you do this, the better you will get and you will find “shortcuts”, such as adding 10 then subtracting 2 when you need to add 8 to some number. 

Also, since you mentioned being a visual learner, I would suggest checking with your local library system to see if they offer access to The Great Courses, and if so, look for the Mastering Mental Math course by Arthur Benjamin. If they don’t offer access to The Great Courses, you could look for his book Secrets of Mental Math."

how to learn Calculus with ONLY geometry?,Get on Khan academy and start with pre-algebra and grind up from there.  Don't waste your or anyone else's time trying to skip steps.
how to learn Calculus with ONLY geometry?,"I’ll be direct. It sounds like you have convinced yourself that Calculus I is the only thing holding you back from admission into a stem graduate program.  But that is very likely incorrect. 

I say this as a prof who regularly serves on grad admissions committees in a stem field: your chances of being accepted into a stem graduate program based on an anthropology degree are approximately zero. It’s highly competitive, even to get an offer as someone with decent grades, research experience, and a Bachelor’s degree in the actual field. These people all have Calculus, and quite a bit besides. Even if you took Calculus, that would still put you lower in the priority order than these people.

You should consider looking into interdisciplinary graduate programs that are not as dependent on what your choice of undergraduate degree was. Eg., perhaps law, medicine, business, etc. There are some fields, like UX, that could laterally slide you into a stem field with a humanities background, too. 

I’ve seen this method succeed. My wife had a BA in Art, but then went to grad school for marketing and now has a good career. 

Your other option is probably to do some quite significant retraining, which could mean a lot of remedial/continuing education courses, or even a second Bachelor’s degree. To be clear, this is in principle possible, but I don’t think it would be optimal for most people."

There’s a *reason* that you need all this math to enter a graduate level degree program in a STEM field. Leaving aside that the M in STEM stands for mathematics, math is an essential tool for working in any science, technology, or engineering field.

how to learn Calculus with ONLY geometry?,"If you want a book which details the ""geometric intuition"" behind a great deal of mathematics Roger Penrose's ""The Road to Reality: A complete guide to the laws of the universe"" starts with basic number systems and works up through calculus to the advanced math of vector spaces and  manifolds.

It is not a math or physics textbook. You are unlikely to fully learn calculus from the book BUT I faced similar math struggles and I now understand the *purpose* and *behavior* of a ton of math and because the symbolic math is also presented you get a better feel for how equations act like a balance scale around the equals sign and how items of the left ""balance each other"". 

Don't get the electronic version as equation formatting is broken at times. 

This is a 1000+ page book. It is a *lifetime* learning book not meant to be read cover to cover.  Read first several chapters until you get lost. Then go to chapter you are interested in and try reading that. It will have many cross-links like ""as described in section 2.2” so when you don't understand you go to that section and learn more. 

Penrose is one of the few modern physics/math people who still stresses geometry in an age where pure math is preferred.  Much advanced math, especially involving complex numbers, has a strong geometric underpinning so it makes sense to learn it from both pure and geometric approaches.

And a tip: 

Differential equations are at core just a more detailed way to deal with ""slope"" in simple Cartesian geometry, the rate of change or ""how steep"" a line is. This means, loosely speaking, any time you see a derivative like dx/dt it is talking about how fast x changes as time evolves.

Edit: I forgot to add this is a *lifetiem* learning book. It is *intimidating* and overwhelming but it is the only single0-book I've ever found to provide *visual* explanations for the math *and* for my physics work he teaches the pros and cons of various mathematical approaches to various types of problems. 

And the price is under $25, which is way cheaper than most textbooks and if you like math ... there are more kinds of math in that book than most advanced mathematicians and/or phycisist will every learn.  I've found useful *persepctives* on math not frequently clearly shown."

If you do have dyscalculia, please do what you need to to get proper accommodations. Unfortunately, this is beyond the scope of what I can help with - but it is what I suggest.

I didn’t do well in high school, took time off before coming back to community college, started from the lowest level math classes we offer here to eventually become a peer tutor. It is worth the time and effort to build a solid foundation.

how to learn Calculus with ONLY geometry?,"It’s going to be much harder to learn it with only geometry than the conventional way. If you want to learn calculus you are going to have to start from the basics which is just any average pre calc textbook.  

To get to graduate school any stem field you are going to need a LOT more than basic calculus. If you want to switch careers that’s fine but it will be a long and painful road ahead given your background, not to say it is impossible, just painful. You will need an undergrad in the field you are going to, and you will need to do well in it, otherwise there is no chance."
how to learn Calculus with ONLY geometry?,"Since you're an adult potentially going back to school, I'd encourage you to think about making the courses serve you and your needs rather than trying to just pass courses. You have ideas of what you want so it's good to focus on what serves that. What I mean by this is: if your goal is engineering grad school, then use your undergraduate math courses and tests to *self-assess your understanding*. If you fail a calc test, while you might worry about your chances of everything getting into engineering grad school--instead id encourage a mindset where *probably will* get in with determination, where if you barely pass calc, you will struggle hard in your future program, and worse, in engineering your mistakes could have serious consequences. So try to think about what kind of understanding and performance you need.

Do you *need* algebra to understand calculus? At all high level, it's only a small amount you need for understanding. But you do *need* it to succeed in a course, and algebra is much more fundamental to many concepts in engineering than calculus! Having a solid foundation in algebra will make everything way way easier. Trust me. Do not go into this trying to get away with learning less. It will literally be harder, take longer, and be more frustrating to try to avoid fundamentals. Every single person I know who struggled in calculus looked back at the class and said something like ""i didn't really struggle with calculus, I just sucked at algebra"". Its a hard course for people with poor algebra skills. 

I would say that your goal should not *just* be passing calc-- calc is a milestone to be sure, but engineering is definitely a field where you need to actually understand what is going on or you will be a very sad potato.

With all that said, if a student came to me with what you wrote above, I'd try to find some ways to ballpark where you are. Can you watch any of the amazing wonderful and intuitive 3Blue1Brown youtube videos on calculus and come away with any understanding, or does it go over your head [if you had 0 understanding of algebra it would]? If you can stomach them, try to watch them all. If you don't understand why an equation can be manipulated in a way that he does, try to find out what rules in algebra he is using. If you are organized, keep a list of the algebra concepts you have to learn along the way. The first time you see something, it's a ""trick"", but after that, it's a ""technique"" that you should try to remember.

Good luck!"

I also noticed there were some really advanced students doing Olympiad prep, which was cool to see, but I never felt out of place even though I was just trying to get better at school math.

If you want a formal argument, then you'd look up the whole injective/surjective/bijective definitions that try to get some formal sense of how to think of how 'big' sets are.

>if you were to assume that natural infinity and square infinity ARE NOT the same size,  it doesn't *seem* like that would cause you to make any incorrect predictions about any kind of real world phenomena

If there are more natural numbers than square numbers, then there must be some natural numbers that I cannot square, because I'd run out of answers.

If there are less natural numbers than square numbers, then there are some square numbers that have no corresponding natural number.

Both of those scenarios seem ridiculous to me, and if I fully believed them, might cause me some problems.

Maybe in the real world I can say ""The numbers I'm missing are so big that I'll never encounter them."", since, well, there are infinitely many of them, so we can push the problem back as far as you want. But if you realise that you can push the problem back *without end* (since it is infinite), then that's just realising there never will be a problem, and so you *can* square every natural, and every square has a natural number that you can square to get it. And at that point, aren't we just believing that there are the same amount of each numbers in each set?"
What is the purpose of treating all countable infinite sets as the same size?,"There are different ways to talk about the sizes of infinite sets. It is of course obviously true that in terms of natural density or set containment the evens are 'smaller' than the naturals.

What is the purpose of treating all countable infinite sets as the same size?,"It depends on how far you're willing to stretch ""real world phenomena"".

On the first note the number 1 is written in black ink and every note following that has the successor of the number on the previous note written on it, also in black ink, such that the notes are labeled by the natural numbers, 1,2,3,.... Every note also has a red number written on it, below the black number. And every red number is exactly the square of the black number above it.

How many notes are there? Looking at the black numbers it seems clear that there are exactly as many as there are natural numbers. Looking at the red numbers it seems clear that there are exactly as many as there are square numbers. Hence those quantities must be equal."
What is the purpose of treating all countable infinite sets as the same size?,"There are many notions of size. Cardinality is just one of them.

Cardinality is a useful measure of the size of sets when working with set theory. In pure set theory we do not care specifically about the nature of the elements in the set, but instead the entire set itself as one object.

You say ""it's also true that all square numbers are natural numbers but not all natural numbers are square numbers"", but the set itself does not know what square numbers are. From the perspective of the set, it just has a bunch of objects in it with certain names: ""1,2,3,4,..."" or ""1,4,9,16,..."". We never told the set what multiplication is, so it can't possibly understand what squared numbers are. We just think of these sets as being the ""natural numbers"" or the ""square numbers"" because we have some intuition on what structure we could put on these sets."
What is the purpose of treating all countable infinite sets as the same size?,">rises beyond the level of supporting evidence to the realm of definitive proof that both sets are the same size.

What is the purpose of treating all countable infinite sets as the same size?,"Not sure if this helps, but you might think of it this way. As a thought experiment, write down your set of natural numbers on an infinitely long sheet of paper. Now suppose we decide to use a different way to write the numbers, like maybe we’re teaching this to an alien civilization. For every natural number we want to write down, we need to translate it for the aliens. Fundamentally, there is no difference between the human set and the alien set, so we can argue that they are the same size and in fact are just different ways to write down the same set.

If that makes sense to you, then next imagine that the aliens write 0 as 0, 1 as 1, 2 as 4, 3 as 9, etc."
What is the purpose of treating all countable infinite sets as the same size?,"So here’s an example of a theorem that arises as an *application* of cardinal arithmetic as usually defined:

The real numbers are **not** the countable union of countable sets.

How do we prove this? Well, the axiom of choice (actually you don’t need full AC—countable choice will do here) proves that the countable union of countable sets is itself countable, **but** R is uncountable, as shown by Cantor’s famous diagonal argument.

So, why is this theorem important? Well, it gives certain information about the real numbers, for example topological information, R viewed as a vector space over Q, etc.

And all this follows from the *usual* definition of cardinality, where it doesn’t matter how crazily defined your countable set is (for example: let Phi_n be the n’th Turing machine. There’s not really an obvious ordering!), the fact is, it’s countable, and that means you can make a perfectly defined list out of it, perhaps modulo some reordering of indices.

Now, are there *different* ways to measure the size of infinite objects? Yes, depending on the subject. Take for example **natural density**, defined as follows: let A be a subset of the natural numbers, let [n] be the set {1,2,…,n}, and let A(n)=|[n] \cap A|. Then the natural density d(A) = \lim_{n->infinity} A(n)/n. For example, let A be the set of all even numbers. Then d(A)=1/2, since A(n)=floor(n/2).

Another example is the Lebesgue measure. The interval [0,1] has infinitely many numbers in it (uncountable many, indeed), but how big is it compared to the interval [0,2]? Well, the Lebesgue measure assigns a size to sets of reals (some sets are sadly unmeasurable [if Choice holds!]) in such a way that measures the “mass” of that interval. In our cases, μ([a,b])=b-a for all intervals of reals [a,b] for -infinity<a<b<infinity. This is also a valid way to measure size."
What is the purpose of treating all countable infinite sets as the same size?,"It's due to how cardinality is defined; two sets have the same cardinality iff you can pair up elements from the two sets one-to-one with none left over. Every natural number has a square, and every square number has a root, so they pair up evenly. 

The concept is a way to extend the idea of counting finite sets to infinite ones; you can understand counting as pairing up items with increasing numbers (a b c d e) <-> (1 2 3 4 5), and cardinality lets you do similarly to infinite sets.

There are other forms of size for objects (like the different forms of measure), but cardinality is one of the best known and most generic, applying to any kind of set."
What is the purpose of treating all countable infinite sets as the same size?,"They're not the same size. Talking about something's ""size"" when you're discussing infinities doesn't make sense in the first place. That's why the concept of cardinality was created. Its precisely defined so that while it does behave similar to the concept of ""size"" for finite objects, it also lets you expand it to be useful when discussing infinite objects as well. And it works out that way because that's how its defined, because doing so lets you compare infinite objects without being inconsistent."
What is the purpose of treating all countable infinite sets as the same size?,"Is it possible to write a computer program that can solve any arbitrary problem? No!

Let’s only worry about “problems” that amount to properties of natural numbers: “is it even”, “is it prime?”, etc. Such problems are essentially functions from the naturals to {0, 1}. (For each number, f(n) = 1 iff the property is true.)

There are uncountably many such functions, but only countably many computer programs."
What is the purpose of treating all countable infinite sets as the same size?,"(Part 1/2) There are a couple points of confusion here. Let me see if I can help organize some ideas.

'Size' means lots of different things, usually with respect to a given metric (way of measuring). For example, it's standard to say the interval \[1,3\] has measure 2, and \[1,4\] has measure 3, so \[1,4\] is 'larger' in this sense (even though they have the same cardinality). But cardinality is in a sense the most fundamental way of talking about size.

Suppose you have 12 apples and 12 oranges on a table, and I ask you which one there are more of. What you would probably do is count 1,2,3,...,12 apples and 1,2,3,...,12 oranges and tell me there are the same amount. This process assigns an *order* to each collection, then uses the resultant orders to draw conclusions about which one there is more of. But at a deep level this ordering is unnecessary, it's an extra step. Consider the following collections of dots:

`A: ...............................`  
`B: ...............................`

Which collection is larger? One way would be to count all the A dots up to 31, and all the B dots up to 31, and conclude that they have the same amount because 31=31, but we don't need to. Just by looking we can see that *all* of the A dots line up with all of the B dots. This one-to-one correspondence tells us they have the same amount of dots, without needing to even think about ordering them.

This isn't particularly important for finite numbers, because for every finite set has a unique order, and that order always corresponds with its size. If you have 17 things, then no matter how you count them, you will always count up to 17. However, for infinite sets order and size start to behave very differently!

For example, consider the set of naturals {0,1,2,3,...}. One way to order them is 0,1,2,3,4,5... and ever element has a finite position in the list. Another way to order them is to put 0 at the end: 1,2,3,4,5...,0. Now 0 has an infinite position! Or we could order them odds before evens like 1,3,5,7,9,...,2,4,6,8,10...0. Here all of the evens have infinite positions, and 0 comes after two infinite lists! So if we want to assign sizes to infinite sets, we can't use the method of ordering them first, because there's no longer a unique way of doing so.

Fortunately, we can still use one-to-one correspondence to determine when two sets are the same size. Just like with the dots above, the naturals and squares are the same size because we can line them with a 1-to-1 correspondence:

`0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,...`  
`0, 1, 4, 9,16,25,36,49,...`

It's true that every square is a natural, and the naturals contain 'extra' numbers that aren't squares, but those extras elements are not enough to bring us up to a larger size of infinity."
What is the purpose of treating all countable infinite sets as the same size?,"Cardinality is just one way to define the ""size"" of a set -- although a very important one. 

Its motivation are finite sets, where it is enough to count the number of elements to determine its size. For finite sets, if two sets have the same number of elements, they have equal size. However, that idea does not nicely translate to infinite sets, since we cannot compare infinities...

However, there is an alternative way to look at finite sets -- when they have the same number of elements, we can map elements between those sets one-to-one, i.e. there exists a bijection between those sets. For finite sets, this alternative view does exactly the same as counting elements before -- but with the added benefit that the bijection approach *does* extend nicely to infinite sets."
What is the purpose of treating all countable infinite sets as the same size?,"I think that we can try to distinguish the idea of ""labeling"" and ""being a subset of"".

Intuitively, you can imagine that have a bijection between two sets (think of it as a unique arrow between elements of two sets) has the same idea as ""corresponding their objects"" one-to-one. So, this is akin to saying I can ""relabel"" the object of a set so by uniquely associating it to a unique element in another set. However, we can see that relabeling an object doesn't really change the nature of the object itself. But re-labeling would allow us to organize the objects in different ways depending on the labels we use.

So, if you can see that in your head, you can see that such correspondence between two sets basically tells us that the objects between two sets actually ""count the same"" (even though it's named uncountable).

In realm of ""infinity"", if the above idea makes sense, then we can find bijection between two sets, then we can possibly find way of relabeling the objects so that one set is a strict subset of another.

This can intuitively explain why we can find bijection between odd numbers and natural numbers although odd number is strict subset of natural number. Different labeling can yield different set relationships even though the objects we are labeling don't inherently change.

Though, in a sense, the notion of ""infinity"" can be viewed from ZFC set theory's Axiom of Infinity. If we disagree with such axiom, then we might need some other way of explaining the idea of infinity or maybe rejecting the notion. However, I think that the axiom makes sense to me, as much as the axiom of choice despite some controversy."
What is the purpose of treating all countable infinite sets as the same size?,"One way to understand it is to consider that if you have two different sets and you can match every element in set A to exactly 1 element in set B and vice verse then the sets are the same size, and we can tell they’re the same size without needing to know the size of either set.  Now if we take all the natural numbers we can match it to it’s square so 1 would just be paired with 1, 2 would get paired with 4, 3 would get paired with 9, 4 would get paired with 16, and so on.  Neither any natural numbers nor any square numbers are left out in this process.  Now I know that it might not feel like the natural numbers and the sets are the same size but that’s because every square number is a natural number but not every natural number is a square number rather than because of one set really having a bigger size."
What is the purpose of treating all countable infinite sets as the same size?,"From what I know infinities are more of categorized by their order of magnitude. This would be like the difference between the infinity of all natural numbers and the infinity of all real numbers. They are categorized differently because between 1 and 2 of the natural numbers there is an infinite number of real numbers so real numbers is an infinite number of infinities. I think there are also proofs for showing if one infinity is larger than the other within the same magnitude. This would be like the different between all, forget the exact term, all positive integers and all positive and negative integers."
What is the purpose of treating all countable infinite sets as the same size?,"You’re using a computing device right now, and considerations of cardinality are closely tied to the theory of computability, so that’s a real-world application. Once you group infinities by their cardinality, there is an entire field of mathematics where you generate different cardinalities of infinity: a never-ending (“infinite” doesn’t begin to capture it) bestiary of infinities with different properties, uncountable, approachable or unapproachable… These do not describe real-world phenomena but that’s not the point. If you want to compare, say computer programs to real numbers, there’s an important sense in which there are too many real numbers to be computed."
What is the purpose of treating all countable infinite sets as the same size?,"The purpose of treating all countable infinities as the same size is because they are. 

Infinity isn’t like a number line it is like a clock face.  It always goes. There is no end. You can move the clockhand around infinitely. So if you have a countably infinite number, it could be expressed using the clock. All of its numbers could be mapped by giving a degree+rotations to us on the clock face."
What is the purpose of treating all countable infinite sets as the same size?,"\> I don't quite get why cardinality supersedes that in importance.  
It doesn't.  
Cardinality does have some big advantages over using subsets though. Firstly, cardinality doesn't change if we rename the elements in the set, which really is the point of cardinality. If I take {1, 2, 3, 4...} and rename 2 to 4, 3 to 9, 4 to 16 etc all I've done is given each element a different name, so intuitively it shouldn't have changed size.  
Secondly it allows us to compare any two sets you want, rather than being restricted to when one is a subset of the other. Taking this further, we end up with an equivalence relation ""has the same cardinality as"", and what do we get with equivalence relations? Equivalence classes! We can now group all sets very neatly into equivalence classes based on wether they have the same cardinality or not.

Perhaps the most important thing to understand here is that we can do all of this without ever knowing what a number is. You do not need to know that {cat, dog, bird} and {fish, cow, pig} have three elements each to know they have the same cardinality, you just match up the elements. It's actually these equivalence classes that we can use to define numbers themselves. In particular, the Von Neumann ordinals define 0 as the empty set (it has 0 elements), 1 as {0} (it has 1 element), 2 as {1, 0}, 3 as {2, 1, 0} etc. That is to say, using the Von Neumann ordinals, 3 is simply a representative of the equivalence class of sets with three things in them.

There are of course, other exciting ways of defining natural numbers, such as Church numerals, we're not beholden to one particular way."
What is the purpose of treating all countable infinite sets as the same size?,"Cardinality is just one of many ways to quantify the ""size"" of a set. For finite sets, it matches our intuition about size precisely. For infinite sets, it starts getting unintuitive when there are other ways of sizing sets that are more intuitive, for example:

We can compare sets by the partial order of subset relations. This matches intuition for your example really well: squares are a subset of natural numbers, and for example, odd squares are a subset of squares, so this is one sense in which there are ""fewer"" odd squares than squares, and ""fewer"" squares than natural numbers. But the limitation of the subset relation is that it's a partial order, meaning, that some sets will be incomparable, for example, are there more squares than primes?

A big advantage of cardinality is that it's applicable to all sets: you can compare primes to squares to real numbers to sets of strings of letters to sets of functions, and it will tell you something about how those sets compare, even though it's a bit ""crude"" in that all you can say about a countably infinite set in terms of cardinality is that it's countably infinite. 

As an aside, we also more often than not use measures rather than cardinality to compare *un*countably infinite sets: it's how we can talk about the real interval (3,6) being bigger than (0,1), even though the cardinalities of those sets are the same."
What is the purpose of treating all countable infinite sets as the same size?,"You're being thrown off by the fact that square numbers are a subset of natural numbers, but what if the map wasn't n -> n^(2), but like, n -> n^(2)i, where i is the imaginary unit? The square imaginary numbers should be the same size as the square numbers, but now they're not a subset of the naturals, you can't say stuff like 'all square numbers are natural numbers but not all natural numbers are square numbers'.

Cardinality takes into account all possible maps that you can define on the set, it is a more generally applicable definition. It has nothing to do with whether one set is a subset of the other set or not. If there exists a bijection, they're the same size. If exist injections and no surjections, or vice versa, one set is bigger."
What is the purpose of treating all countable infinite sets as the same size?,"I'll preface this with my view is not an accepted view. My view is that you can assign a measure to the set of naturals as a length of one. Then the set of evens can be viewed in at least two different contexts:  
i) In terms of natural density, where we start with the set of naturals and remove every odd member resulting in a set that has a measure of length one-half. Then the natural density is a length of one-half divided by a length of one.  
ii) In terms of cardinality in set theory, where we start with the set of naturals and multiply each natural number by two, resulting in a set that is the same size as the set we started with and has a measure of a length of one.

In this way, there is an idea that the set of evens can be extended to varying infinite sizes by just adding more even members."
What is the purpose of treating all countable infinite sets as the same size?,"Idk it just makes sense to me when compares to uncountable infinities. I'm not sure I really see much beyond the way countable infinities are all smaller than uncountable ones and the way countables can be matched up up to infinity and uncountables cant

The Hilberts hotel proof I think illustrates it the best for me at least. All countable infinitities can fit into the HH. There's always some trick you can think of to make enough room for any countable infinity trying to get rooms in the HH and the HH is always full. But an uncountable infinity cannot fit into the HH. 

Infinity isn't the biggest number you can imagine. That number is still closer to 0 than it is to infinity. It doesn't matter if you count one at a time, or by squares, or by any countable way. It will take infinite counting to reach infinity. You can throw mathematical operations at Grahams humber to blow it up to abjrd proportions and its still closer to 0 than to infinity. 

Any comparison of relative size at a finite point in the set is finite. It doesn't matter that squares keep getting bigger faster than their roots. It still takes infinitely long in counting squares to reach infinity which is the same amount of ""time"" it takes to get there by counting Natural Numbers or any other countably infinite set. 

Thats just how I see it. 

Infinity is a concept, not a nunber. It acts like a very large number sometimes but that's not what it is."
What is the purpose of treating all countable infinite sets as the same size?,"Yes, as other answers say, the way of measuring size is context dependent. For example, we would say that ""If you pick a real number in \[0, 1\] at random, then the probability it is a rational number is 0"" but it wouldn't be reasonable to then compare the set of rational numbers to the empty set. However, from the lens of probability theory (or, more generally, measure theory) they are ""the same"". In this measure-theoretic model, it is helpful to think in this way but in other models it is not.

It's similar with cardinality. However, I think from the point of view of pure set theory (e.g., you're not interested in specifics about the sets, just the absolute sizes), it is the right model.

I hope that's useful! 😊"
What is the purpose of treating all countable infinite sets as the same size?,"*> as the same* ***size***

Those sets are not the same *size*, rather they are the same *cardinality* which is a specific technical concept with a specific technical definition.

If it doesn't match up with your idea of what ""size"" should mean, that is fine.  You can still sort of hold the concept of *cardinality* over to the side as something that has a certain meaning and use in the mathematical world.

It’s that simple. Any countable set also has quantity Aleph-null, since it can mapped one-to-one to the naturals. The irrationals and reals are examples of uncountable infinity (not Aleph-null).

then there is what happens if you do match the numbers. and it is a very common setup to have the prize be split among everyone who matched the numbers. ill call the chance of being the only person who picked those numbers `p(unique)`

what most people care about with lotteries (how much they win) is based on `p(match + unique)`, not just `p(match)` on its own

`p(match)` is constant for a given number of choices/options. eg in UK the standard lottery is i think choosing 6 numbers from a possible 49, any set of 6 will always have the same chance.

`p(unique)` is where it gets complicated though, basically you need to factor in human behaviour here and consider which numbers are most likely for people to choose. eg it is known to be very popular to choose the numbers 1-31 due to people picking birthdays or other important dates. so if you pick in the range 32-max you will avoid anyone who uses that method

a decent random number generator probably has better odds of avoiding having to share than any other scheme you could come up with (as any approach that would give predictable/consistent results has a chance that someone else used the same approach)"

"Is there a ""grammar"" to a mathematical formula?","There's a formal grammar in all areas of symbolic communication and rigorous statements in mathematics and science. An elementary example is PEMDAS, and formal language theory (you'll see stuff like Chomsky normal form), but pretty much anything in science can be analyzed for formal grammatical structures -- so if you ask one scholar or another to look at the same paper and ask if an assertion is rigorous, they will generally agree, and generally agree on why, even in a field that is not strict mathematics.

And there's also an informal grammar. For example, if I were write something like P = mrω^(2) / 4πr^(2) , then the fact that I have *r* in both the numerator and denominator, unreduced, is not grammatically incorrect -- I am *communicating* something to the reader. (In this case, that P = F/A, that the numerator is centripetal force, and the denominator is the surface area of the sphere, and making this derivation explicit in the equation.) Furthermore, in writing this equation inline in this paragraph, I make orthographic choices such as to put spaces around the ""/"" symbol, but not to space out the multiplication symbol, and not to put parentheses around the denominator even though by strict PEMDAS rules they would be necessary, etc. These are *informal* grammatical rules, that are generally agreed upon, such that my communication is still unambiguous within this forum."

Logs on Logs on Logs,"For the sake of phone friendly notation, let L(x) denote the base 10 logarithm of x and log(b,x) denote the base b logarithm of x. The log base change identity gives us

> log(b,x) = L(x)/L(b). 

So your expression can be written as

> [L(7)/L(3)] [L(9)/L(5)] ... [L(25)/L(21)] [L(27)/L(23)],

and we can then use how multiplication of fractions works to make that one big fraction, like:

> [L(7) L(9) … L(25) L(27)] / [L(3) L(5) … L(21) L(23)]. 

We can immediately cancel a bunch of factors to be left with

> [L(25) L(27)] / [L(3) L(5)]. 

We can then pair up convenient factors in the numerator and denominator

> [L(25)/L(5)] [L(27)/L(3)]. 

Then convert this back into logarithms of other bases:

> [log(5,25)] [log(3,27)].

Logs on Logs on Logs,"Having watched the video after giving a solution in a comment here, I thought I might leave some constructive feedback.

* You immediately use the log base change formula but don't explain where it comes from or how it could be derived. It's obviously crucial to solving this question, is an incredibly helpful tool for other problems, and its existence is a really fascinating part of logarithms that any student should be encouraged to think about rather than just pull from memory. But you don't really comment on that; you just pull it out as a tool. Wouldn't take long to derive, either. I imagine a student who didn't immediately think of it when they first saw the question posed would be left none this wiser by how you use it in the video, but maybe they're not your intended audience.
* There's also no comment on **why** that formula should be something the student thinks about in this question. Lots of students struggle with just feeling like they don't know how to start a problem. It would probably help to talk about why converting a product of logs with different bases to a product of fractions is a good idea in this instance. Something like 'notice that the arguments of each log forms a sequence, and the bases of these logs form a very similar sequence; wouldn't it be great if we could find a way to cancel them out?' would do the job to open the hood under the problem solving process.
* Once you have the expression as a product of fractions, the way forward is clearly related to things like Telescoping Series. Signposting that this is actually a commonly used method for evaluating series and products in other problems would be great.
* For my taste, saying ""this cancels out with terms in the ellipsis"" is very hand-wavey and could easily be formalised without losing the audience. Talk about a general term of the sequence: log(2n+5)/log(2n+1) and draw their attention to the fact that the numerator of the k^(th) term cancels with the denominator of the (k+2)^(th) and the denominator of the k^(th) cancels with the numerator of the (k-2)^(th) or similar, and therefore all we're left with is the first two denominators and the last two numerators.
* When you get \[log(25)log(27)\]/\[log(3)log(5)\] you cite another rule about logs (i.e. log(a^(b)) = b log(a)) without explanation or derivation. Seems like an oversight. Also seems like an oversight not to relate this to or ground it with reference to the log base change formula you used earlier.
* I also think there are more interesting questions about the problem, like ""can we construct other such sequences or is this one unique?"", and how one might look for similar patterns, and what (if anything) they might show us. The fact that this product comes out as a natural number ought to be a surprise to most students, so getting them to think about why could be an easy win.
* Lastly, 'logs on logs on logs' (for me at least) evokes things like ""log(log(log(x)))"" rather than the product of logs. This is my most petty note, but the fact that the title evokes something unrelated to the problem is annoying and might be easily avoided. Though regional uses of the expression may vary and perhaps your intended audience will immediately 'get it'.

Granted, I'm not sure what audience you're trying to reach or what messages you're trying to imbue. But it feels like there are some more important lessons (like where we get the base change formula from, or how to approach a novel problem) you've missed and some much more interesting questions (like whether or not the fact you can make a sequence of logs give a product of a natural number tells us much, or if there are other sequences out there like this) that you easily could have stretched for and just haven't. By not looking at those, what's left feels like little more than a 'here's an example of me doing a test question without showing any of the thoughts behind it' video. That would be good for a student working through past papers, but your back catalog doesn't really suggest that you're covering whole sections from past papers or textbooks."

Why is this particle speeding up if the acceleration is negative?,"Acceleration is a vector, so if something is accelerating in one direction it is decelerating in the other. Finding the velocity at t=4, it is negative. So the acceleration acts in the opposite direction to motion. So it is slowing down."
Why is this particle speeding up if the acceleration is negative?,"At t = 4 the velocity and acceleration have opposite signs so the particle is slowing down. If they had the same sign then the particle would be speeding up.

Let's think through why that works.

Imagine you are on a train with an engine at either end so it can easily travel in either direction along the track. You designate one direction along the track as positive and the other as negative.

Let's consider four sequential scenarios:

**I.** The conductor turns on the engine that starts moving the train faster and faster in the positive direction. Looking out the window, you would describe the train to be speeding up.

Note the following:

>• You are traveling in the positive direction, so your velocity is positive.
>
>• Your train is experiencing a net force in the positive direction, so your acceleration is positive.
>
>• So your velocity and acceleration have identical signs (and thus have the same direction).

**II.** The conductor now turns off that engine and applies the brakes. Looking out the window, you would describe the train to be slowing down.

Note the following:

>• You are still traveling in the positive direction, so your velocity is positive.
>
>• Your train is experiencing a net force in the negative direction, so your acceleration is negative.
>
>• So your velocity and acceleration have opposite signs (and thus have opposite directions).

**III.** Once the train stops, the conductor turns on the other engine which begins to move the train faster and faster in the negative direction. Looking out the window, you would describe the train to be speeding up.

Note the following:

>• You are traveling in the negative direction, so your velocity is negative.
>
>• Your train is experiencing a net force in the negative direction, so your acceleration is negative.
>
>• So your velocity and acceleration have identical signs (and thus have the same direction).

**IV.** The conductor now turns off that second engine and again applies the brakes. Looking out the window, you would describe the train to be slowing down.

Note the following:

>• You are still traveling in the negative direction, so your velocity is negative.
>
>• Your train is experiencing a net force in the positive direction, so your acceleration is positive.
>
>• So your velocity and acceleration have opposite signs (and thus have opposite directions).

So the intuition that positive acceleration means ""speeding up"" and negative acceleration is ""slowing down"" is only correct for the first two scenarios where the velocity was positive. That rule gets reversed when you are moving in the negative direction.

(And the choice of which direction would be ""positive"" was arbitrary, so a person sitting next to you on the train could have chosen differently and the two of you would always disagree on whether the train was speeding up or slowing down. 😄)

But rather than try to memorize four different cases, let's notice what *is* consistent:

>In all of the scenarios where the velocity and acceleration have identical signs (and thus have the same direction), the train was speeding up.

>In all of the scenarios where the velocity and acceleration have opposite signs (and thus opposite directions), the train was slowing down.

So what matters as far as ""speeding up"" and ""slowing down"" are concerned isn't just whether the acceleration is positive or negative; **what really matters is whether the acceleration and velocity have identical signs or opposite signs!**

I hope that helps. 😀"
Why is this particle speeding up if the acceleration is negative?,"The particle is slowing down, AND the velocity is increasing. Consider going from -5m/s to -2m/s for example. The velocity has increased (positive acceleration) but the particle has slowed down.

Why is this particle speeding up if the acceleration is negative?,"Speed is a scalar (value with only magnitude)

Acceleration and velocity are vectors (has magnitude and direction)

The negative is merely a direction.

If we think of left as negative and right as positive, a negative acceleration is a force pushing the object to the left. If the object is already moving left, then accelerating it left will be increasing the magnitude of the velocity (speed)"
Why is this particle speeding up if the acceleration is negative?,Basically just that speed is the **absolute value** of velocity.
Why is this particle speeding up if the acceleration is negative?,"I didn’t read all the details, but just going off the title: did you consider that maybe the *velocity* might be negative too?

Edit: your last paragraph contradicts your title. It seems you’re *actually* asking, “why *isn’t* this particle speeding up if the acceleration is *positive*?” My answer ends up being the same though: did you consider that the velocity might be negative?"
Why is this particle speeding up if the acceleration is negative?,"Think of it like this: a = (vf-vi)/t    \[vf = final velocity    vi = initial velocity    t = time\]

If vf = -8 km/h and vi = -2km/h, then a = \[-8-(-2)\]/t = -6/t = - acceleration.

However if we take a look at the velocities, the object is going from 2km/h to 8km/h. The negative just indicates the direction. So, the object is speeding up, even though its acceleration is negative."
Why is this particle speeding up if the acceleration is negative?,"At t=4 the velocity is negative and the acceleration is positive, meaning that the speed in the negative direction is decreasing, so the particle is slowing down."
Why is this particle speeding up if the acceleration is negative?,"Compare the sign of the velocity to the sign of acceleration. If the sign of velocity and acceleration are the same, then it is speeding up, even if they are both negative.

Velocity at t=4 is negative, acceleration is positive, so the speed will be changing in a direction towards zero, and therefore slowing down."
Why is this particle speeding up if the acceleration is negative?,"Most of the time with this kind of problem it is very helpful to graph the different functions under question so that you can see what is happening:

[https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ag9lhr5qpy](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ag9lhr5qpy)

If you trace each of the curves - position, velocity, and acceleration - you'll soon work out exactly what is going on, and how each of the curves relates to the others.

The other  thing to remember is that whenever you are dealing with concepts like velocity and acceleration, these numbers are not just *values* but *vectors* \- meaning that they have both a magnitude and a direction associated with them.

A question like ""is the particle slowing down"" is not asking whether velocity is increasing or decreasing, but rather: Whether the *magnitude* of the velocity is increasing or decreasing.

When you are talking about something like a 3-dimensional vector, [calculating the magnitude of the vector is actually a bit of a process](https://www.cuemath.com/magnitude-of-a-vector-formula/).

But for a two-dimensional vector like this one, it is easy: Just take the absolute value of the velocity.

Translating the question into ""math"": *is the particle speeding up or slowing down* becomes *is the absolute value of the velocity getting larger or smaller.*"
Why is this particle speeding up if the acceleration is negative?,"Speed is a scalar, whereas acceleration affects velocity, which is a vector (and therefore has direction). If the particle is already traveling backwards compared to the reference frame, then a negative acceleration will result in it moving backwards even faster."
Why is this particle speeding up if the acceleration is negative?,"It's all about the difference between speed and velocity. 


Velocity has a magnitude and a direction; it's a vector. Speed has a magnitude, but no direction.


Acceleration is the derivative of velocity with respect to time, but the question you're asking, ""is it speeding up or slowing down?"", is asking about the derivative of speed with respect to time. 


In the one-dimensional case, this seems like a pretty minor distinction, because it really only manifests in the way you're seeing here, with the sign being wrong. This is because the magnitude of a one-dimensional quantity is just its absolute value, so the derivative of the magnitude differs by, at most, a sign. 


So, in the specific case you're describing, a positive acceleration is causing the value of v to increase, but since v was negative, an increase in v is causing a decrease in the speed |v|.


The same thing happens if you throw a ball into the air: gravity is accelerating the ball towards the earth, but because the initial velocity of the ball was away from the earth, it initially slows its ascent before speeding up again as it falls.


In two dimensions or more, the situation gets more interesting. Here a vector is often written as multiple perpendicular components, and the magnitude is the diagonal length of the cube with those component sides. You need the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the magnitude.


This can lead to effects that are much more subtle; an acceleration that adds to one component of the velocity but takes away from another can end up affecting the direction of the velocity, but not its magnitude. I.e., you've got a nonzero derivative for velocity, but the derivative of speed is zero. This is how orbits work; things in orbit are *still* accelerating towards the planet, but their speed, height, and direction are all balanced in such a way that, not only does the acceleration not change the speed, it also keeps the direction tangent to the orbit. It's a really neat result that kind of falls out of the math if you shake it in the right way.


So it's worth trying to understand the distinction at play here. This isn't just a trick of the arithmetic. There's an actual distinction being made."
Why is this particle speeding up if the acceleration is negative?,"A positive acceleration means it is accelerating in the direction you've defined as the positive direction. If at that time it also had a positive velocity, that would mean that the velocity is getting bigger, or ""accelerating"".

If, however, at this time the particle had a negative velocity, that would mean it was moving in the negative direction, opposite the of positive acceleration. Because the particle is accelerating in the positive direction, the particle's velocity is changing to be more positive than it used to be, which in this case means the velocity is getting less negative, or in other words the overall speed is getting smaller, or ""decelerating"". 

Part of why this is confusing is because depending on the context the word ""accelerating"" can mean ""changing velocity"" or it can mean ""increasing speed"", and these competing definitions do not mean the same thing mathematically speaking."
Why is this particle speeding up if the acceleration is negative?,"It would help if you think carefully about the definitions of the terms acceleration and deceleration, and exactly what makes them antonyms (i.e., opposite of each other). 

In 1-D motion, true acceleration in the colloquial sense occurs whenever the algebraic signs of both acceleration and velocity variables match (i.e., they point in the same direction, either both positive or both negative). 

On the other hand, if acceleration has a sign opposite that of velocity, then deceleration is happening (this is actually how deceleration is formally defined). 

Of course, the situation is more complex with 2- or 3-D vectors, so in these cases, it helps to compute the magnitude function of the velocity, i.e. speed, and check whether the speed function is increasing or decreasing at any given instant. "
Why is this particle speeding up if the acceleration is negative?,"You already got a lot of good answers, so allow me to..

>This might be classified as more of a physics problem

>It's velocity at any point is given by t^3 - 3t^2 - 8t + 3.

That t^3 seems completely unphysical to me. I'd categorise it as a math question. Also, note the absence of units. That makes the dimensions wrong. You simply cannot add t^3 and t^2. A physics question wouldn't ask for t=4, but it would give a unit. t=4s for example. And the equation would be something like v(t) = 1 m/s^4 t^3 +...

Your mistake is here:

This is a very common mistake people make. What you should have is that Anthony’s number of steps = y and Peter’s number of steps = 1.1y. When you use these numbers instead, the speed Anthony t goes to school at is v and the speed Peter travels at is 0.99v, which is clearly slower. "
Are you smarter than an 8th grader? Problem I found in an old textbook and dont remember how to solve,"speed = step length × step rate

Let's use Anthony's speed as a base. Call his step length 1 and rate 1. Peter's step length is 0.9 and rate 1.1, giving a speed of 0.99.

Anthony arrives first.

Your mistake is here:

> Anthony's number of steps = 0.9y

The problem specifically states that Peter takes 10% more steps than Anthony in a given time. That's *not the same thing* as saying that Anthony takes 10% fewer steps than Peter in that time, which is what you have.

If Anthony takes 100 steps in time T, Peter takes 110, so Anthony's number of steps is 0.90909…y, not 0.9y."
Are you smarter than an 8th grader? Problem I found in an old textbook and dont remember how to solve,"Speed = stride length x step frequency

Let L = Anthony's stride length and F = his step frequency. Anthony's speed is LF. 

Peter's stride length is 90% of Anthony's, or 0.9L.

In the same time period, Peter takes 10% more steps than Anthony. So Peter's step frequency is 110% of Anthony's, or 1.1F.

Peter's speed is (0.9L)(1.1F) = 0.99LF. So Peter walks 1% slower than Anthony, meaning Anthony will arrive first.

Unless they're racing or there's something really urgent at school for Anthony but not so much for Peter, this is rather rude. Anthony should slow down and walk with Peter."

Are you smarter than an 8th grader? Problem I found in an old textbook and dont remember how to solve,"You're not taking into account that Peter takes more steps in the same period of time. It is probably easiest to calculate their relative speed. To do that, it pays to look at the units. If Anthony's step length is x m/step, and he takes y number of steps per unit of time, so let's say y steps/s, you can see from the units that you should multiply those to get his speed. Since speed is in distance/time, in this case m/s. So his speed is x\*y

Peters step length is 0.9x, and he takes 1.1y steps per unit of time. So his speed is .99x\*y

Anthony gets there first"

Are you smarter than an 8th grader? Problem I found in an old textbook and dont remember how to solve,"**Short answer:** Both of you are wrong -- Anthony arrives first.
***
**Long(er) answer:** Since Anthony and Peter start walking at the same time, it is enough to compare their velocities. We're given two information (""p := 0.1""):

    sp  =  (1-p)*sa    // sa, sp:  step-sizes of Anthony and Peter
    np  =  (1+p)*na    // na, np:  #steps per period of Anthony and Peter

If ""T"" is the period length, then we may estimate Peter's velocity ""vp"" via

    vp  =  np*sp/T  =  (1-p)*(1+p)*na*sa/T  =  (1-p^2)*va  <  va

Peter walks slower than Anthony, so Anthony arrives at school first."

I think the question is not very good though, because I'm not sure it develops a good intuition in the student. Fractions of a step are not possible in real life. A more realistic example is it takes less time for me to complete a step, but my steps are shorter. In that case we alternate who is ahead until we sync back up on my 10th (your 9th) step and we're tied in terms of distance.

Are you smarter than an 8th grader? Problem I found in an old textbook and dont remember how to solve,"The simple approach to this problem is to assume that Anthony takes 1 meter steps, 1 per second.

After 10 seconds, Anthony will have taken 10 1-meter steps, for a total length traveled of 10m.

After 10 seconds, Peter will have traveled 9m in 10 steps, but he will have taken one additional step of 0.9m, for a total length traveled of 9 + 0.9 = 9.9m.

When you reduce a number by 10% and then increase it by 10%, it ends up 1% short:

    (0.9*x)*1.1 = 1.1*0.9*x = 0.99x

Another way to think about this is let's introduce a parameter `a`, and we multiply x by `1 + a` and `1 - a`:

    y = (1 + a)*(1 - a)*x
    = (1 - a^2)*x

So you can see that whenever you multiply by a bit less than one and then multiply again by that same amount more, this nets out to a factor that is a bit less than one by the square of the difference."

Person B has a 10% shorter stride (0.9s) and takes 10% more steps (1.1n). Person B's distance: (0.9s) \* (1.1n) = 0.99 \* (s \* n) While 0.99 \* (s \* n) is slightly less than (s \* n), the difference is small enough to be considered negligible.

Confused about immeasurable set,Measurable is related to a measure (see [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics))). This isn't really related to cardinality.
Confused about immeasurable set,"First of all, measure (as in measure theory) and cardinality are two different ways of measuring set ""sizes"". The former generalizes the idea of calculating lengths, areas, volumes and the latter formalize notion of different sizes of infinities.

Ok, now for the first question if you take a power set P(A) of set A that is the set of all subsets of A then it is indeed bigger in terms of cardinality than A. You talk about infinite subsets which is instead a subset of P(A), but still in this scenario should be bigger.

For measurability part, I'm not sure what you exactly ask about. In generality a measurable (sub)set is just a set that has defined measure value for some particular measure. In case of Lebesgue measure, not all subsets of (0,1) are measurable, because otherwise it would create some ""weird"" situations in short."

How do you do rational functions/expressions (or just algebra in general) at all??,"Assuming you mean:

f(x) = (2x² + x - 6)/(x² + 3x + 2)


# Domain

What's the **domain**? Well, in general, the domain is **any values you can 'safely' plug in that won't cause your function to blow up.**

Can this function 'blow up' and fail to give us back a result? Addition and subtraction are 'safe'; the only possible point of failure is the division. We don't want to divide by zero. So the domain must be _everything except for where the denominator is 0_.

We literally do not care about the numerator for this - we *just* care about the denominator.

So when is (x² + 3x + 2) equal to 0? Well, it factors as (x+1)(x+2). So the 'dangerous' values are x = -1 and x = -2!

# Holes

Let's look at the function in its factored form.

f(x) = (2x-3)(x+2) / (x+1)(x+2) 

Now I'm going to do a weird thing - I'm going to ""unsimplify"" this expression, by ""unmultiplying"" two fractions.

f(x) = [ (2x-3)/(x+1) ] · [ (x+2)/(x+2) ]

This is *almost* the same thing as a simpler function. I'll call it g:

g(x) = [(2x-3)/(x+1)]

What's that second fraction doing? Most of the time, it's just multiplying by 1. That doesn't do anything! The only exception is when x=-2: that just blows up the function.

So that extra multiplication just 'pokes a hole' at x=-2, and doesn't do anything else! **f is the same as g, except for that hole!**

Where did it poke the hole? Well, f doesn't tell you, but g [the *pre-hole-poked* version of f] can! Find g(-2), and you get -7 / -1, or 7. So **the hole is at (-2,7).**

# Vertical Asymptotes

We can't plug in x=-1. But what happens if we plug in something close to it?

If we plug in, say, x=-.999, we get:

f(-.999) = (2(-.999) - 3)(-.999 + 2)/(-.999 + 1)(-.999 + 2)

Or as I like to think about it...

... = (-5ish)(1ish)/(TINY)(1ish)

Since the denominator is tiny, the result will be *huge* - and the closer we get to x=-1, the tinier the denominator will be, and the bigger the result. This is gonna shoot off to infinity! **We have a vertical asymptote at x=-1**!

# Drawing the Graph

What do we want the graph to show?

The important things are probably:

- the zeroes
- holes
- behaviour near asymptotes
- end behaviour

Zeroes: Well we can just read those off the factored form. Where is the numerator 0?  At x=3/2 and x=2. But we have a hole at x=2, so the only zero is at x=3/2.

Holes: Already figured out that the hole is at (-2,7).

Behaviour near asymptotes: We know it's going to shoot off to infinity - but which way, up or down? The easiest way is to just plug in x=-.999... except we don't need the exact value, just the sign.


> f(-.999) = (neg)(pos)/(pos)(pos)

> f(-1.001) = (neg)(pos)/(neg)(pos)

So it's going to go up on the left side, and down on the right.

End behaviour: What happens when we plug in some huge number, like a trillion? We get:

> f(a trillion) = (2 trillion - 3)(1 trillion + 2)/(1 trillion + 1)(1 trillion + 2)

At this scale, the -3, +2, and +1 don't really do much at all! So...

> f(a trillion) ≈ (2 trillion)(1 trillion)/(1 trillion)(1 trillion) = 2

So on the right side, we have a horizontal asymptote at y=2. And if we plug in ""negative 1 trillion"", we see the same on the left side.

And that's all the information we need to graph! Maybe get the y-intercept too as a reference point (just plug in x=0; you get y=-3)

Now we have [this graph](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/k3mi5uichr), and we can just draw the rest of the lines in between!"

How do you do rational functions/expressions (or just algebra in general) at all??,"It sounds like when they give you a rational function, they want to know where the vertical asymptotes are, and if there are any holes in the graph? To work that out, you'll want to factor the numerator and denominator out into parts like (x-3), (x+1), etc. like you did in your post. On the bottom, anywhere one of those factors is equal to zero, you'll get a vertical asymptote, or a hole, or something like that. If the factor is in both the numerator and denominator of the rational function, like (x+2) in your post, you'll get a hole at x=-2, because -2+2 = 0 and you can't have a zero in the denominator. However, you can cancel these factors out from the top and bottom and get a new rational function that does not have that hole. If the factor is in the denominator, but not the numerator, then when it is equal to zero you'll get a vertical asymptote, because as you get close to the x where it becomes zero the denominator gets very very small, making the function as a whole very very large. If the factor is in the numerator, but not the denominator, then when that factor is equal to zero, the whole function is equal to zero, because any number times zero is zero. 

That should help you draw out graphs for these things without using a graphing calculator."
How do you do rational functions/expressions (or just algebra in general) at all??,"I didnt read the whole post but intuitive explanation of one of the concepts of this unit:

Lets say you had a function like this: f(x) = x\^3 + x\^2 + x + 1. As x gets really large, x\^3 shoots past every other term, and eventually you can just ignore every other term and your error would be negligibly small

So, when you look at something like 2x^(2) \+ x -6 / x^(2) \+ 3x +2, you know that when x gets really large, the only terms that matter on both sides are the quadratic terms, meaning you can approximate this function by just 2x^(2) / x^(2)

Which is just 2 because the x^(2) cancels out

But if the numerator was 2x^(3) \+ x -6 then the ratio would become 2x, which goes to infinity. Therefore your entire function goes to infinity as x goes up. Likewise, if it was 2x + x -6 then the ratio would become 1/x, which goes to 0."

Best way to study for a rigorous real analysis exam?,"Is this your first mathematics class that focuses on theorems and proofs? If so, that is probably your biggest challenge, but once you get comfortable with it you've opened the door to *all* of higher mathematics. If that's the case, find places in the book when it says ""Theorem: ... Proof: ... QED."" and study those with a magnifying glass. Really try to figure out what's going on. Do you understand what the theorem claims? Is it obviously true? If not, does the proof *persuade* you that it is true? How? What facts does the proof take for granted? How are they stitched together to build up to the theorem?"

How to start studying Putnam?,"I think there are really two important keys: *practice* and *society*.

For practice: The Putnam has almost complete archives of past exams. Pick a problem from the last ten years (don't go back much further than two decades, because styles in problem-setting change slowly, and you want exams that resemble modern ones). Sit down and try to solve it. At first, don't put yourself under any time pressure. Take as long as you need to solve the problem you've picked. Now, some people disagree with me about this, but I think that you do 99% of your actual learning in the very few minutes right around the time that you find the solution *for yourself* and write it down. The hours of work leading up to that magic moment might teach you stamina, but not any actual mathematics. Now here's the crucial point: in comparison, having somebody *tell* you the solution will teach you almost nothing. First of all, it's not nearly as intense an experience; second, you aren't likely to really engage with a provided answer; and third, the actual answer is just a fraction of what you need. I might show you the answer, and you could look at it and agree that it's correct, but still not have the faintest idea how I found it.

So I advise people *not to look up answers at all*. If you work on a problem for two weeks (say, an hour a night) and are making no headway at all, then *still* don't look at the answer. Just set the problem aside and start working on another one. Every once in a while, go back through your personal archive of unsolved problems to see if you have any fresh ideas. As your skills improve, you'll find that problems that once stumped you now fall within your range.

Now, for society: find other people with about your age and background who are also interesting in training up for the Putnam. Form a club. Meet once a week. Have some pizza and just geek out about what you've been studying and whether you've learned anything cool. Having others around you who are also interested is a strong incentive and catalyst for making progress.

Much less important, but it still could help: side reading. I recommend that you start getting into the recreational mathematics literature. Martin Gardner wrote more than a dozen collections of columns he wrote for his Scientific American column in the 1950's, 1960's, and 1970's. Any library of decent size will have one or two -- just look up Martin Gardner in the catalog. Another great book is Albert Beiler's *Recreations in the Theory of Numbers: The Queen of Mathematics Entertains*. Yet another is by John Conway and Richard Guy, called *The Book of Numbers*. Read these for pleasure in between practice sessions. It all helps you get in the habit of thinking mathematically.

Enjoy your mathematical journey!"

Quotient limit problem,"We know

p(x) = (x-a)^(5)s(x)  
q(x) = (x-a)^(7)t(x)

p(x)/q(x) = (x-a)^(5)s(x) / \[ (x-a)^(7)t(x) \] =  1/(x-a)^(2) \* s(x)/t(x).

s(x)/t(x) is ""well-behaved"" around x=a, so the main thing to consider is what happens to 1/(x-a)^(2) as x approaches a."

Understanding the point of the unit circle,"this is something that is taught backwards in high school math. the fact that cos and sin are the coordinates of a point on the unit circle is THE actual fundamental reason why these functions are important. it's why mathematicians care about them, it's how you should think about them, and it's how they should be taught to math students for the first time. the relation to right angled triangles should then be deduced as a consequence of the unit circle definition, rather than being the starting point.

the connection to right angled triangles is kind of ""accidental"" and not particularly fundamental, and in my experience, doesn't come up very often in math beyond high school."
Understanding the point of the unit circle,"You aren't being dull at all!

I think you might have the order of things slightly backwards. In my experience, circles tend to be the thing that people want to understand, and triangles are useful for studying circles. A very common question that people want the answer to is ""if I start at the point (1,0) and walk along the unit circle a distance of X, what point will I end up at?"" The answer to that question is ""I will end up at the point (cos(X * 180°/ π ), sin(X * 180°/ π))"". This ends up being the more useful way of thinking about sine and cosine than ratios of side lengths of triangles. And notice that it now makes sense to talk about angles larger than pi/2 radians since you can walk around a circle as far as you want, you don't have to stop once you reach the top of the circle.

When you're only talking about triangles, the unit circle might seem like a bit of an unnecessary abstraction, but sine and cosine always show up when you're working on something involving circles. In physics, for example, it's very common to study objects that move along a circular path. To describe that path numerically, you will use sine and cosine somewhere."
Understanding the point of the unit circle,The unit circle lets you do some basic trig in your head. That’s about all it does.
Understanding the point of the unit circle,"Different people learn differently. The unit circle helps some people. If you understand trigonometry without the unit circle, then don’t worry about it too much."
Understanding the point of the unit circle,"The triangle itself is really just a way of visualizing. Really you should just be focusing on the ""hypotenuse"" itself. This is a line with a specific length and direction, which we call a ""vector.""

Vectors are used to describe a huge variety of things,  a common example is the velocity of an object/vehicle. One of the main way I use vectors is to represent data sets.

One major use of sine and cosine is that they describe relationships between vectors, for example the degree to which they ""point in the same direction."" In the context of velocity, this might describe something like the effect of a headwind on an airplane. The applications are way too far reaching to list exhaustively here.

The *unit circle* refers to the fact that all of the vectors (hypotenuses) have length one (these are called *unit vectors*) and the point is simply that this eliminates the effect of varying length and focuses purely on direction."
Understanding the point of the unit circle,"> When it goes past the 90deg or PI/2 I kinda don't get it. The triangles formed are still effectively right angles but flipped. So of course the sin & cos ratio still applies. So why is it beneficial to go to the effort of having a full circle to represent this?

If you think about the circle on the x/y axes, then the axes split the circle into 4 quadrants. While the lengths of the sides of the triangles are the same, the x/y coordinates of each point on the unit circle is x=cos(𝜗), y=sin(𝜗). The trig functions change sign accordingly with the quadrant.

* Quadrant 1: x,y>0 
* Quadrant 2: x<0,y>0
* Quadrant 3: x,y<0
* Quadrant 4: x>0,y<0"
Understanding the point of the unit circle,"Drawing the reference triangle in the correct quadrant allows you to determine whether the function is positive or negative in that quadrant.

cos(60°)=+1/2 because ADJ/HYP = +/+=+

cos(120°)=-1/2 because  ADJ/HYP = -/+=-

cos(240°)=-1/2 because ADJ/HYP = -/+=-

cos(300°)=+1/2  because ADJ/HYP = +/+=+"
Understanding the point of the unit circle,"Sine and cosine are only defined for angles between 0 and 90 degrees when you use the SPH CAH TOA definition, since those are the only angles that can be found in a right triangle. The unit circle generalizes the definitions of sine and cosine by equating their values to y and x coordinates on the unit circle respectively. This way, we are able to concretely talk about values of sine and cosine for any angle, even including angles larger than 360° and negative angles."
Understanding the point of the unit circle,"It's really great you noticed that the other portions of the circle are reflections of the quarter arc between 0 and π/2.  Those symmetries are incredibly useful (have a sine, but need a cosine?  Got a 3π/2 but can only eat half a pi?  BAM! Symmetry's got your back).  But when you start working with vectors, knowing which way you're going is suddenly very important and the unit circle is a handy way to remember that.  It's also a handy way to recall which of sine and cosine are even or odd as functions.  

Basically, the unit circle is a powerful tool for visualizing a lot of important concepts in math, and the farther in math and physics you go, the more it will be your friend.  So take satisfaction that you have recognized a very profound symmetry and get back to memorizing the sine, cosine, and tangents of 0, π, π/2, π/3, π/4, π/6."
Understanding the point of the unit circle,"The biggest use that I get out of the unit circle in my day to day is not in the triangle ratios, although they definitely come through, but in [Euler's formula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_formula)

If you're familiar with linear algebra at all, the unit circle becomes a basis (yes, literally) for many functions you would stumble into in the wild.

How do I find the missing numbers when adding up in perimeter,"You should be able to figure out the lengths of the unlabeled sides indirectly. If you have a notch cut out of a box so that the side is 10m long, and the full length would have been 12m, how long is the notch?"
How do I find the missing numbers when adding up in perimeter,"The sides of the little cut away are just the difference of top and bottom and of the left and right sides.

Interestingly enough, you don't actually need to know how long they are or even how long the right and bottom sides are (assuming we know all the angles are right angles). The 2 shorter horizontal sides will always add to 12 and the two shorter vertical sides will always add to 10. So the perimeter will still be 44 no matter how big the missing piece is."
How do I find the missing numbers when adding up in perimeter,"Mirror the bottom-right corner outward, so you get a rectangle ""10cm x 12cm"" with the same perimeter ""p"" as the given object -- that leads to ""p = 2\*(10+12)cm = 44cm"""

Trying to learn Calculus from an Algebra 1 background.,"You shouldn't go straight from Algebra 1 to Calculus 1, there's gonna be huge gaps in your knowledge.

Just take Algebra 2 or Precalc during your Junior year, and then Calc 1 during your senior year, and even that's kind of pushing it IMO. Really you should take both Algebra 2 and Precalc before Calc 1.

Don't feel left behind, you aren't. Usually people retake Calc 1 in College to brush up anyways, especially if they're gonna study something math related."
Trying to learn Calculus from an Algebra 1 background.,"before hitting any calc, you'll want a solid foundation of algebra 1/2, geometry, and trig/precalc/math analysis.  its better to have a strong foundation then hitting an arbitrary timeline. I wouldnt worry about college credit too much either, but if you want to get the training before college, look into your local community or junior college and taking courses there instead, in particular if they have a good track record of being able to transfer credit.  the rigor and training will be more consistent with ""4-year college/university"" courses then any AP course."
Axiom of Choice Paradox and set sizes that are not Natural/Positive Integers.,"She's not using ""size"" to mean ""cardinality"", she's using ""size"" to mean ""measure"". Measure is the generalization of length; the measure of an interval \[a, b\] is the real number (b - a). If you mentally replace the word size with ""length"" you'll have a pretty accurate informal notion of what measure is."
Axiom of Choice Paradox and set sizes that are not Natural/Positive Integers.,"Measure and cardinality are very different concepts. From your description ""size"" is being used to refer to measure.

For example, in the reals, \[0,2\] has twice the measure of \[0,1\] as you'd expect, even though they have the same cardinality. The integers (which have lower cardinality than the reals) have measure 0 in the reals, but so does the Cantor set (which has the same cardinality as the reals).

The question becomes, does every subset have a measure? The Axiom of Choice, or more specifically a statement that is implied by AC but might be weaker than it, the weak partition principle, says ""no"" — there are sets to which no measure, not even 0, can be assigned.

(This might sound like a good reason to reject AC, but it turns out that the consequences of that might be worse: without the weak partition principle, it is possible to partition the reals into more non-overlapping non-empty subsets than there are real numbers to put in those subsets.)"
Axiom of Choice Paradox and set sizes that are not Natural/Positive Integers.,"So there isn't a singular idea of ""size"" in mathematics, instead there's several somewhat related ones. What you're thinking about is cardinality: a property of sets which basically counts how many elements they have. Indeed, the cardinality of [-1;2] is (uncountable) infinity.

But the notion the video's author is talking about is measure, specifically the Lebesgue measure. It's a generalization of length: the measure (length) of [a,b] is b-a. You can probably see why someone would refer to the length of something as it's size: for a similar example, when you ask about the size of a ball, you care about its diameter/volume, not the number of points in it."
Axiom of Choice Paradox and set sizes that are not Natural/Positive Integers.,"It's the Vitali set. She is referring to the length of the union of the sets, and since they are disjoint, the length is just the sum of the lengths of each set.

The concept of length is a particular case of something called a ""measure"", which is another way to assess the ""size"" of a set."
Axiom of Choice Paradox and set sizes that are not Natural/Positive Integers.,"“Size” here refers to [measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)), not cardinality. In particular, the [Lebesgue measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue_measure)."
Good textbooks for combinatorics and number theory for self study.,Susanna Epps' Discrete Math with applications is a good broad textbook that will cover a number of topics you might want to know.
Good textbooks for combinatorics and number theory for self study.,"Although there is some overlap between them, combinatorics and number theory are usually treated as separate subjects. There is usually a good introductory unit on combinatorics in any ""discrete mathematics"" textbook, of which there are now many, but I don't have a specific recommendation. Perhaps another commenter will have one. Once you have gotten started in combinatorics, though, I strongly recommend Herbert Wilf's quirky book *generatingfunctionology* (all one word, lower case), which is usually available online for free with the author's blessing.

For number theory there is an embarrassment of riches, with many good available textbooks. I'll keep to authorized free online stuff. Karl-Dieter Crisman wrote and maintains *Number Theory: In Context and Interactive*. It's unique feature is that it's integrated with the number-theory and computer algebra system called SageMath, so you can try experiments right out of the book. Sage is widely used in the field and is worth learning. You can find a copy easily by searching for the author and title.

Another free site is Bruce Ikenaga's, at [https://sites.millersville.edu/bikenaga/number-theory/number-theory-notes.html](https://sites.millersville.edu/bikenaga/number-theory/number-theory-notes.html), which is more of a set of lecture notes. It doesn't have too many good exercises, and is probably aimed at a more mathematically mature student, but the explanations are very good.

All the sources I've mentioned assume that you are comfortable with the definition/theorem/proof style of mathematical exposition. If you're *not* then you should probably remedy that problem separately, first. *All* of higher mathematics depends on your familiarity with these concepts. If you're not sure, go through a couple of sections of Crisman and see if you feel like you are in over your head. If you can get through the first set of exercises with no real trouble (section 1.4), you're fine and can keep going. But if not, you should probably go through an introduction to mathematical proof like Daniel Velleman's *How to Prove It*."

"Are There as Many Real Numbers in (-1,1) as in R - (-1,1)?","> However, there are far more real numbers between 0 and 1 whose reciprocals are not natural numbers. This clearly suggests that the set of real numbers in (0,1) is much larger than the set of natural numbers.

Your alternate way to prove it is not correct. If by ""much larger"" you mean ""different cardinality"", your conclusion is wrong. Just because a set A is a strict subset of another set B does not mean their cardinality have to be different. Consider the following map:

f:[0,1] --> [0,2] defined as

f(x) = 2x

This is clearly bijective between [0,1] and [0,2], so both sets have the same cardinality by definition, but [0,1] is a subset of [0,2].

And that's indeed a feature which only infinite sets have: You can have a bijection between the set and one of its proper subsets.

For that reason, the set {1/n where n ∈ N} being a proper subset of [0,1] is not enough to conclude that their cardinalities are different. They are, but not because one is a subset of the other."
"Are There as Many Real Numbers in (-1,1) as in R - (-1,1)?","Yes there are. And there's as many numbers in (-1,1) as there are real numbers. Actually any interval subset of the real numbers will have the same cardinality as the entire real numbers"
"Are There as Many Real Numbers in (-1,1) as in R - (-1,1)?","Yes. 

And it is weird.

This is why when it comes to infinite sets, instead of saying they have the ""same number of elements"" we say they have the ""same cardinality.""  Weirdness avoided."
"Are There as Many Real Numbers in (-1,1) as in R - (-1,1)?","You can look at the sigmoid function. If you set the parameters right, it can map all the real numbers to (-1,1). And since it’s a bijection, it means they have the same cardinality :P"
"Are There as Many Real Numbers in (-1,1) as in R - (-1,1)?","Yes, every range of reals that contains more than one real has the same cardinality as the whole of R, and likewise for all unions of such ranges. So (-1,1), (-∞,-1), (1,∞), (-∞,1)∪(1,∞), and R all have the same cardinality."
"Are There as Many Real Numbers in (-1,1) as in R - (-1,1)?","Hobbyist mathmo here. Advantage: can usually explain so that I am understood. Disadvantage: might not have as good an understanding as someone formally trained.

Here's how I see it. When we say how many there are of something we are counting. And when we count we use integers. And, although the set of integers is infinite it does not contain 'infinity'. Infinity is not an integer.

If you ask how many elements there are in Real(0,1), the answer is infinity. It is beyond our ability to count. And that is important because all of the arithmetic that we use daily is based upon the concept of counting. So, when dealing with infinite sets it is important to note that the systems of algebra we use daily will no longer work. 

You notice that mathematicians tend often to be cautious about the language they use the comparing infinite sets. They tend to say ""they have the same cardinality"" rather than ""they have the same number of members"" because ""number of members"" implies that counting them will lead to an integer result.

Maybe someone will recommend a good introductory book. I don't have one. I do recommend watching videos on the Hilbert Hotel problem. It isn't directly related to your problem here but it is a good introduction to the concept of infinity. Dealing with the Hilbert Hotel moved me from ""this doesn't make sense"" to ""OK, so the rules are different here"". Maybe it will do the same for you."
"Are There as Many Real Numbers in (-1,1) as in R - (-1,1)?","> there are far more real numbers between 0 and 1 whose reciprocals are not natural numbers.

> But what if instead of only reciprocating natural numbers, if we take the reciprocal of every real number greater than 1 or less than -1 (I mean from the set ""R - (-1,1)"") their reciprocals fall within the interval (-1,1). This means that for every real number in the set ""R - (-1,1)"", there exists a corresponding element in the range (-1,1). This establishes a perfect one-to-one mapping between these two sets. Suggesting that there are same number of elements in both set.

Yes. Absolutely correct! Congratulations, you are getting the hang of how to think about cardinalities.

> which is absurd because intuitively, the set should contain infinitely more numbers than (-1,1)

As is always the case, when your intuition and your reasoning clash, the intution must be wrong.

Just a moment earlier you built an ironclad proof showing that `ℝ \ (-1,1)` has the same cardinality as the interval `[1,1]`, and you did it by creating an explicit bijection between the two sets. Your argument is ironclad.

So, what's wrong with your intuition? You are expecting the notions of length and cardinality to coincide! Turns out they don't, and you have wonderfully foigured it out yourself. Now that you know those are two distinct notions, you can trin your intuition to not see this result as absurd.

> Maybe this isn't a unique idea it seems simple enough that many people might have thought about it. 

The fact that all the intervals of real numbers have the same cardinality as the set of real numbers is well known. It is one of the first results we show the students in order to break down the common intuition that bigger length means bigger cardinality.


> I would love to hear an explanation that makes sense of this. 

The proof you constructed is the explanation! Kudos on coming up with it yourself.

Trust your reasoning skills more than your intuition."
"Are There as Many Real Numbers in (-1,1) as in R - (-1,1)?",">Suggesting that there are same number of elements in both set. which is absurd because intuitively, the set should contain infinitely more numbers than (-1,1).

A simpler example that might be easier to understand is that there are as many even numbers as naturals. Intuitively, the evens are a subset of the naturals, so there are at least as many naturals as there are evens, and there are infinitely many naturals that are not evens (i.e. odd numbers). However, they are the same size, because there is a 1-1 correspondence.

`1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...`  
`2, 4, 6, 8,10,12,14...`

You might be confusing the concepts of cardinality and measure. The set (1,3) has twice the measure as (1,2) in the standard metric, but they are the same cardinality because their elements have a 1-1 correspondence."
"Are There as Many Real Numbers in (-1,1) as in R - (-1,1)?","> every natural number can be mapped to a unique real number in that range. 

Yep. This demonstrates the cardinality of the naturals is equal to or less than the cardinality of (0,1). 

> but there are far more numbers in that range. 

Also true. 2/3 doesn’t have a pre-image in **N** under this map. 

>  this clearly suggests the set of real numbers is larger than the set of natural numbers. 

**No, it doesn’t**. Cardinality of infinite sets is tricky and this logic is a trap. Note that the map from the naturals to the integers given by

> f: **N** -> **Z**

> f(n) := n

is injective and that there are infinitely many members of **Z** that don’t get hit by it. But **N** and **Z** have exactly the same cardinality."
"Are There as Many Real Numbers in (-1,1) as in R - (-1,1)?","Yes. Both sets ""A := (-1; 1) c R"" and ""B := R \ (-1; 1)"" do indeed have the same cardinality, though finding a bijection is not trivial. We can do it explicitly^(1) in four steps:

1. Notice ""g(x) := 1/x"" bijectively maps ""A \ {0} -> B \ {±1}""
1. Define a countable exception set ""E := {0} u {1/2^(k), k∈N} c A""
1. Define a bijection ""h: E -> {±1} u g(E\\{0})"" Hilbert-style:

       h(x)  =  /      -1,  x = 0
                \ 2^{k-1},  x = 1/2^k

"Are There as Many Real Numbers in (-1,1) as in R - (-1,1)?","Firstly, the notation is R \ (-1,1)

>> There are far more real numbers between 0 and 1 whose reciprocals are not natural numbers.

This is not as obvious as you make it out to be. The claim that you make here is essentially the same as Cantor's (the non-existence of a bijection (one-to-one mapping) from one infinite set to another). Cantor's proof is more robust than what intuition tells us (intuition is often wrong).

The argument that you made about mapping (-1, 1) to R \ (-1,1) is essentially correct, except for some minor nuances, such as the reciprocal of 0, and the fact that the reciprocal of 1 (which is 1 itself) does not lie in (-1,1). Note that (-1,1) does not include -1 or 1 (if it does, then we use square brackets, e.g. [-1,1])."
"Are There as Many Real Numbers in (-1,1) as in R - (-1,1)?","Let's simplify the set as (0,1). I can prove that there are as many numbers in that set as there are real numbers greater than 1. For every n > 1, there is some unique 0 < 1/n < 1. You can do the same exercise for the negative half of your set. 

One thing you will notice is that I side stepped the issue of zero. We can hand wave that away by saying that all the sets we've mentioned are countably infinite and the fact that zero doesn't get mapped by this specific method doesn't really matter , but a rigorous solution might show that a function can be constructed to map any range of real numbers to any other range of real numbers."
"Are There as Many Real Numbers in (-1,1) as in R - (-1,1)?","This could be explained abstractly through cardinal arithemetic: you basically multiply the cardinality of the continuum with the cardinality of N (since you have that many subsets of the form (n,n+2) in R). Cardinal arithmetic says that the multiplication of two infinite cardinals just gives back the larger cardinal. If you want to get a larger cardinality, you need to put it in the exponent, i.e. 2^alpha for a cardinal alpha. This would be equivalent to taking the powerset."
"Are There as Many Real Numbers in (-1,1) as in R - (-1,1)?","Using that there are “Far more” is not enough with infinite sets and it’s anything but clear you have to be really careful, there are equal numbers in (-1,1) as there are in R, and there as many even integers as there are integers."

Other than being more mindful on what you do not know, I suggest to learn the theory first and do the exercises after, do not rely on teachers, if you think they are not explaining in a way that satisfies you, then learn through other means and don't delegate the responsibility of your knowledge of math on the teacher. 

Here's a simple thought process to follow:

I cannot solve this problem -> why can't I solve it? -> do I understand what the problem is asking me? (if not maybe revisit theory or ask a question on ""what is that?"") -> do I see how to get to one step to the next? Does it require algebra?

Abstract Algebra Problem — Images and Kernels,"For part a) I think your argument actually shows that the image is a subset of the set p(t) such that dp/dt(0) = 0.  Because you took f(t\^2,t\^3) (in the image) and showed that taking the derivative with respect to t and plugging in t =0 gives you 0.

For the reverse direction, that the set of polynomials with dp/dt(0) = 0 is a subset of the image, I'd start with a random polynomial p(t) =  a\_0 + a\_1t + a\_2t\^2 + ... a\_nt\^n.  If p'(0) = 0, what can you say about the coefficients?

I think there might be a typo in part (b).  

I think the map is supposed to be f(x,y) -> f(t\^2-t, t\^3-t) (so that it's kind of like the previous part but a different map).  I think the f(  ) was just accidentally left out maybe."

This looks like total nonsense. `>15 =`???

After some more thought, I think you might be using the math symbol `=` to compare two *statements* that each have a `<` or `>` symbol in them and for some reason only putting quotes around one of those statements. So you're trying to say

1. ""It must be 15<"" is the same as ""it must be 15 or greater""
2. ""It must be >15"" is the same as ""it must be greater than 15""

If my interpretation of your intent is correct, then here is my response:

* `n > 15` means that n is (strictly) greater than 15. So n could be 16 but is not allowed to 15. Writing `15 < n` would descibe exactly the same conditions.
* `n 15<` does make sense.
* `n < 15` means that n is (strictly) less than 15. So n could be 14 but is not allowed to 15. Writing `15 > n` would descibe exactly the same conditions.
* `n ≥ 15` means that n is greater than or equal to 15. So n could be 15 or 16 or something bigger. Writing `15 ≤ n` would descibe exactly the same conditions.
* `n ≤ 15` means that n is less than or equal to 15. So n could be 15 or 14 or something smaller. Writing `15 ≥ n` would descibe exactly the same conditions."

System of non-linear equations,"I agree with u/peno64, this is probably going to require numerical methods with a computer algorithm.

But in general, solving systems of nonlinear equations requires some form of substitution. For instance, if you use the first equation to write x = 1 - y - z, you can substitute that into the next two equations to get two equations in the two unknowns y and z.

Then perhaps you could rearrange the third one (now in y and z) to create a substitution for y or z.

But the result on the middle equation with those two substitutions will be a huge ugly mess of algebra. You're really better off with numerical methods."

How do you solve problems?,Honestly you don't. It tends to be the unuseful turns out useful by practice. And it might come to you by playing about.
How do you solve problems?,"This is a huge question and there's no good way to give a full answer. I imagine different professionals will have very different experiences and methods too... In any case, to respond to the final ""what do you do?"": you struggle! 

I'm not a professional mathematician (my work is more in physics), but when I'm faced with a new problem my first thoughts are ""have I seen anything like this before?"" and ""Is there any way I can relate this problem to some other similar problem that I know something about?"". I think the whole point of doing loads of exercises and learning all your theory is so that, in addition to having technical facility with doing calculations and applying theorems, you build up a database of problems and solutions in your mind that you can (hopefully) draw on in the future. The broader your database is, the better chance you have of solving any particular future problem. ""Creativity' sometimes is really just remembering some obscure fact that happens to work for the problem at hand.

At some point there will be problems that are just too hard and you will never solve them. It's okay.

For effective study when you don't have the answer guide, I'll just say that computers are extremely useful for checking things. Do sanity checks, try extreme values, plot graphs etc. It depends on the problem really. When I was in high school, I learnt the skill of making up my own problems and using computers to check the answers (Wolfram Alpha was great for this)."
How do you solve problems?,"It sounds like a good question, but I'm not really sure I understand it yet. The best thing you could do would be to *give an example* of a math problem that you encountered, and your difficulties in solving it.

You might mean (a) the kind of problem you are given in algebra or trigonometry class; or perhaps (b) the kind that you encounter in real life, where solving it has actual practical importance; or (c) the kind a mathematics graduate student, or professional mathematician, might work on, a ""research problem"" about which one might perhaps write a paper. And the answer and the way it should be presented would vary greatly between these possibilities.

How do you solve problems?,"A mathematician studies by building a deep understanding of the ideas and then working on many problems while checking their work against known results and theorems. When you work on problems by yourself, you can:

1. Learn the theory well by reading texts and lectures. Use clear examples to see how abstract concepts work. For example, Polya’s method in ""How to Solve It"" teaches breaking a problem into smaller parts and testing ideas against known facts. 

2. Practice a lot with simpler exercises first. Even if the books don’t show solutions, try to verify your answers by comparing them with similar solved problems in other texts or online forums like Math StackExchange, where experts discuss methods. 

3. Seek feedback in multiple ways. You mentioned using a subreddit and a Discord channel. In these communities, you can share your solution methods and ask if your reasoning is sound. While direct feedback may be less immediate than in subjects like history, active discussion with peers helps improve your understanding.

4. Write out your solutions carefully. Then, check your work by verifying that each step follows logically and by testing special cases. This self-review is a key practice in research-level mathematics where feedback is often indirect.

5. Understand that mathematics is abstract and building insight takes time. A professional mathematician often collaborates with others and presents ideas in seminars or preprints, which provides more detailed feedback than solo study.

By combining deep study, deliberate practice, and active discussion with peers, you can develop the self-checking habits that professional mathematicians use. This approach, along with modern tools like AI agents and multi-modality resources (which can include interactive problem solvers or digital textbooks), helps in verifying your work. These methods, along with techniques such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for finding information, fine tuning your problem-solving strategies, and prompt engineering your learning queries, support a more productive self-study experience.

create multiple avenues for feedback and keep checking your work against established results."

Please help with Cantor's diagonalization argument,"The argument isn’t applied to a “random” enumeration, it’s done to work for *any* enumeration, including whatever enumeration you have in mind."
Please help with Cantor's diagonalization argument,"We basically *do* use 0.100... repeating to represent 0.1 in the argument. Because 0.1 might be say 1000 down in the list when we get to it, so it needs to have a digit in that place so there's something there to change. So it's simplest to assume for the purposes of the proof that *each* real number is written in it's non-truncated form with a repeating tail if it's rational. (Here we could go back over some of the finer points of using series to define what the decimal system even is in the first place, but you say you aren't a math student so let's just leave that out)

A thornier question is what to do about repeating tails of 9's and 0's. But the argument typically dodges this by ensuring that the new real not in the list doesn't have 9's or 0's in it at all, so it can't run into the issue with non-uniqueness of presentations (e.g. 0.99 repeating = 1.00 repeating). So we make the rule for changing each digit something like, 0↦1, 1↦2, ... , 7↦8, 8↦7, 9↦8, and avoid the issue.

It doesn't matter a bit if the new number we get matches one of the old ones *from some point onward,* because being different at a single digit is enough to ensure that they're not the same number (not the same *real* number). And the diagonal argument guarantees this will be true."
Please help with Cantor's diagonalization argument,"The key point of the list of rational and real numbers is that the list has *every* number, but only once. If rationals and reals were the same size, it would be possible to create a list with each rational and real listed exactly exactly once and each type associated with exactly one of the other type. To prove the sets are different sizes, we need to prove it is impossible to create such a list.

As best I can tell, your method of generating a list doesn't have every real number. Therefore, Cantor can't prove your list is impossible to create. But for basically the same reason, your list can't show rationals and reals are the same size.

We assign each natural to a corresponding real, assuming that it's possible to do so. Then we demonstrate that there exist reals outside of this enumeration, contradicting our assumption. So no, this is incorrect: there are some decimal sequences without natural number ""equivalents""."

Please help with Cantor's diagonalization argument,"Veritasium did a good video on this recently.

 Basically, you can map every element of 1 set of numbers, like the set of Natural Numbers, to the elements of another set of numbers, like the set of integers. You can do this because both of these sets have the same size, more or less. However, for the set of rational numbers, the size of that set must be larger because you can always make a new number that doesn't exist anywhere else in your set and add it to your set, which was already supposed to be infinitely large. Thus, some infinities are larger than others, making them a larger ""class"" of infinity. People often use the terms ""countable infinities"" & ""uncountable infinities"", where uncountable infinites are larger than countable ones, but the name isn't important per se."

And is technically wrong, in more than one way. They are very, very close to being right; these aren't really ""errors,"" they are correctable misinterpretations. And close enough to being correct that well-meaning people will argue that they are right. I wouldn't question them, except for the fact that *every doubt raised about CDA is based on one of the misinterpretations.*

Cantor did not use real numbers. He used infinite-length strings of two characters. His characters were ""m"" and ""w"" for reasons I can't fathom. If published today, it would almost certainly be ""0"" and ""1"". In fact, the discussion in Wikipedia (which is correct, but doesn't emphasize the misinterpretations) uses ""0"" and ""1"".

These strings can be thought of as binary representations of real numbers in \[0,1\]. Two issues arise that way: First, a binary representation does not have to have infinite length; Cantor's strings do. Second, in binary, 0.1000... and 0.0111... both represent 1/2, while ""1000..."" and ""01111..."" are very different strings. This can be circumvented by using more characters (i.e., decimal representation) and being careful with character replacement, but that is completely unnecessary and leads to, well, misinterpretation.

But the important differences are in how ""proof by contradiction"" is used. CDA does not start by assuming you have a complete list of Cantor's strings. It starts with ***any*** list of them that ***actually can be made*** using ***a subset of the complete set of such strings****.* What diagonalization proves is that for any actual list s1, s2, s3, ... of strings that you can make, there must always be a string s0 that (1) is in the complete set but (2) is not in the listed set.

This proves that a complete set cannot be put into such a list, since point #1 would contradict point #2.

Your suggestion is just one way to create an actual list. You convert each natural number in ***N*** to a real number in \[0,1\]. What you don't do is show that every real number in \[0,1\] is represented this way. The ""misinterpretation"" is that faux-CDA can simply ""assume"" a complete list and the diagonalization process will work on it to produce a new number. It won't, but those details are left out of real-CDA since it doesn't work that way.

In fact, 1/3=0.333... is not in the list you create. There is no natural number that can be represented using an infinite number of non-zero digits, yet most of the strings in the set Cantor used will have that property."

How do I deal with all of this?,"Sometimes university is as much about surviving as it is about learning. Mathematics is a beautiful subject which can feel like a mountain that cannot be climbed, but when you take it one step at a time you will realise you’re at the summit without realising it. 

With all of these subjects, the only thing you can do is practice and revise the material. All of the problems you will do in your classes will have a predetermined set of steps needed to solve them. Your job now is to identify those steps, and then identify when to use them. 

Gather as much material as you can, if there are people on your course from the year before you, see if they will send you the questions to their assignments for extra practice. Look online for similar year 1 courses - for extra questions and practice. Perhaps there is a textbook for your classes which goes through these topics and will give you further context. 

Maths is beautiful at this level because either you are right or you are wrong. So, once you know how to get the right answer, you will be able to do well in your exams and then start focusing on the maths you actually want to do (if any)."

Quick question,"Assuming I understand the question correctly, I don't think this is a question of ""correctness"", but rather clarity. Ideally, ""..."" should only be used when it's obvious how a pattern continues.

It looks like your set has all the numbers from 1 to 12, and also 23. You should write enough numbers to make it obvious that you intend this. I think {1,2,3,...,10,11,12,23} is pretty obvious. {1,2,3,...,12,23} is less obvious, but some people might understand it okay. Generally, I'd rather be verbose but obvious than terse but unclear."

Quick question,"I'm not sure there is a ""fully correct"" here.  

I wouldn't say this is a formally defined notation (that would be something like {n ∈ ℕ: (1 ≤ n ≤ 12) ∨ (n = 23)}).  So it's a question of communication - avoiding ambiguity and helping the reader to understand.

{1,2,3, ... 12, 23} is pretty unambiguous in meaning the integers from 1 to 12, plus 23.

{1,2,3..., 11,12,23} might be slightly more helpful because it alerts the reader to the sequence ending with 11 and 12, then 23 being a single value outside that sequence.

there are infinitely long decimals. ex: 1/3, pi, square root of 2. every number that ends is called terminating, and the set of terminating decimals is indeed countable, as its a subset of the rational numbers (numbers that can be represented as a fraction of integers)."
"Mapping all numbers between 0 and 1, to positive integers","Other comments have pointed out the main issue (there are no infinitely long positive integers/natural numbers/whole numbers), but I wanted to expand on that. Because whenever someone gets confused or comes up with a ""disproof"" of Cantor's argument, I would say 95% of the time it's due to this exact confusion.

This begs the question: ""Why must natural numbers be finite? Why can't infinite natural numbers just exist?"" and the answer comes down to how we define natural numbers. I won't go into the formal definitions of natural numbers (look up ""Peano Axioms"" if you wanna learn more), I'll instead give a nice middle-ground definition between pure intuition and strict rigor.

Ultimately, the natural numbers satisfy 3 basic principles:  
1. There is a first natural number (depending on your definition, this could be 0 or 1, but it doesn't really matter)  
2. Every natural number has a ""next"" natural number that's different from all the previous numbers  
3. The natural numbers consist of only the numbers needed to make the first two principles work

In other words, the natural numbers is the smallest, most basic set that allows for ""counting"" without stopping. So starting at 0, we get the next number (1), then the next number (2), then the next number (3), and so on. We can generate a collection of finitely-sized numbers this way, and we can prove that such a collection satisfy the first two principles, so they therefore must contain every natural number. This proves that all natural numbers are finite.

  
The fact that natural numbers cannot be infinite, but real numbers can have infinitely-long decimal representations is a key detail in why there the real numbers are uncountable."

I cant stop working things out in my head. how do i stop?,"> how i work it out: lets say for example a 38% increase in 735$ what i'd do is get 10% which is 73.5$ then times it by 3 to get 30% which is 220.5$% then i'd half it to get 5% which is 36.75$ then i'd get 1% which is 7.35$ then times it by 3 which is 279$.

Sure, this is valid, if a bit convoluted. You're saying that:

(.38)735 = 3(0.10)735 + (1/2)(0.10)735 + 3(0.01)735

I would probably give marks for writing that out. What the method that you're supposed to be using? You're basically doing column multiplication indirectly.

Now, the probability you get it at 15 is .5^15. The probability of getting it at 16 is also .5^15. And so on. Additionally, the probability you didn't get it at those is (1-.5^15). Notably, the probability before 15 is 0 as there aren't enough to get to 15. So I believe that the total probability should be 986*32767/32768^2 which is about 0.03 or 3%.

"Probability of ""streaks"" in a series.","**Assumptions:** All coin flips are fair and independent. We want to find the probability to get (at least) one H-run of (at least) length-r.
***
**Claim:** The probability to get (at least) one H-run of (at least) length-r is ""P(E_nr') = 1 - xn/2^n "", where ""xn"" follows the recursion

    n >= r:    x_{n+1}  =  2*xn - x_{n-r}    // initial values:  0 <= n < r:  xn = 2^n
                                             //                       n = r:  xr = 2^r - 1
***
**Proof:** Flipping a coin ""n"" times can be modelled as a length-n HT-sequence. By the assumptions, all 2^n such sequences are equally likely, so it is enough to count favorable outcomes. Since that is difficult, consider the complement instead. Let us call a HT-sequence *valid*, if it does *not* contain a length-r H-run. Define

* `E_nr:` event to get a valid sequence after ""n"" coin flips
* `hn, tn:` number of length-n valid sequences, ending in ""H, T"", respectively

We are interested in ""P(E_nr')"". Notice any length-n valid sequence can be created by a length-(n-1) valid sequence by adding either ""H"" or ""T"" at the end. Consider both options separately:

1. We may add ""T"" to any length-n valid sequence to get a valid sequence
1. We may add ""H"" to any length-n valid sequence, except those ending in (r-1)xH, followed by ""T""

Note the exceptions in 2. are precisely length-(n-r+1) valid sequences ending in ""T"", if we add ""(r-1)xH"". We now may write both cases as recursions:

    1.    t_{n+1}  =  hn + tn,                  n >= 0              (1)
    1.    h_{n+1}  =  hn + tn - t_{n-(r-1)},    n >= r              (2)

Let ""xn := hn + tn"" be the total number of valid sequences. Adding (1)+(2), we get a recursion for ""xn"":

    n >= r:    x_{n+1}  =  2*xn - t_{n-r+1}    // using (1)
                        =  2*xn - x_{n-r}                           (3)

Since there cannot be a length-r H-run for ""n < r"", we also have the initial values

    0 <= n < r:    xn  =  2^n                                       (4)
         n = r:    xr  =  2^r - 1             // exclude ""H...H""

Any winning strategy for this game?,"All of this is going to be incredibly pedantic and ugly and nontrivial because it invokes zero sum game theory with a lot of variables.

Essentially, the naive approach ""do a basic binary search"" is countered by player 2's strategy of ""figure out what a basic binary search loses on the hardest, and pick one of those numbers"". But then player 1 can do a modified binary search that hits those numbers. Picking 51 takes a while to find if you started at 50, but starting a binary search at 51 is barely less efficient than starting at 50, and counters the counter. And then they counter the counter the counter the counter with infinite recursion.

Have you done simultaneous equations? Like x+y = 5, x - y = 1, solve for x and y?  This is that but worse.

Basically, if there were a simple answer like ""pick 40"" then the guesser would know that and always guess 40.

Is there a winning strategy? Yes. But to find it basically what you would have to do is you take the 100 choices for player one, give each one a probability that they pick: p_1, p_2... p_100

Then for player 2 you have probabilities for their first pick for each of the 100 numbers, q_1,1, q_1,2...q_1,100. And THEN probabilities for their second pick q_2,1...q_2,100, etc etc. And then you have to set up a bunch of standard nash equilibrium indifference equations where all of them are equally good or else it wouldn't be an equilibrium, and then you end up with literally five hundred simultaneous equations with five hundred variables and have to solve it.

The explanation above was somewhat sloppy, you actually have to do some conditional stuff (like if you guess 80 and they say higher then actually you can ignore 80 variables and only focus on the ones higher than 80), but that can make it more complicated because then you have to do conditional probabilities based on every contingency.

So is there an answer out there somewhere? Yes. Do I know what it is? No. But generally answers to questions like this look something like ""pick a random number so you can't be predicted, but weight it so that the naturally obvious numbers for your side like picking 99 or starting a binary search at 50 have slightly higher probability of being picked since the inherent value outweighs the predictability"""
Any winning strategy for this game?,"> if the guesser gets it right their first try, they get 5 dollars, on the their second 4 dollars, and so on(you can lose money, so if they don’t get it on yout 6th guess, the guesser owes the chooser 1 dollar and so on).

Assuming random choice, and pessimistically letting the number always be in the larger of the two intervals (because it's obnoxious to write out otherwise) you have:

E[X] = 5(1/100) + 4(99/100)(1/50) + 3(99/100)(49/50)(1/25) + 2(99/100)(49/50)(24/25)(1/12) + (99/100)(49/50)(24/25)(11/12)(1/6) - (99/100)(49/50)(24/25)(11/12)(5/6)(2/3)

In order to get to the second choice you have to have missed the first choice, and then your search interval is half of the previous."
Any winning strategy for this game?,"First of all, you can binary search to the exact number in 7 guesses. So if the chooser chooses the numbers that are last in a binary search, they'll gain 2 dollars every time. 

To combat this, the guesser can modify his binary search algorithm to use a random pivot point. 

If you choose a different initial guess, i.e. 55 instead of 50, then you might end up ""unlucky"" and need to search in the 0-55 range next. However,  you can still pinpoint the number exactly with 7 guesses total if you start with 55. That's because with 7 guesses you could guess a number exactly up to 128, so you have some room left.

Intuitively, I purpose the guesser chooses a random guess such that they'll never need more than 7 guesses. I.e. since 2^6 = 64, the initial guess will be made between 36 and 64 (100-2^6, 2^6)

In case they choose exactly 36 or 64 and get unlucky, the rest is just binary search because there's a range of 64 numbers to search in 6 guesses. But in case a number in between is chosen, there's still randomness ""left"" for the second guess. 

I.e. if you choose 54 first and the number is lower, you'd choose in the 22 to 32 range next. I.e. (54-2^5, 2^5). 

It's beyond my ability to prove this is an optimal guessing strategy, but I have a feeling that the additional randomness in the guesses will eliminate any optimal choice for the chooser. 

I'd recommend running some simulations to see if all numbers can be guessed equally fast on average using such a strategy."

"I’m a teenager, but was never given a proper education. How do I teach myself?","One way you could go about it is to look up a curriculum/syllabus (probably the one in your region if available) and use it as a reference in planning your own learning. The curriculum can serve as a checklist of topics and give you some idea of how to sequence them. Then you look up resources (videos, books, websites, etc) that cover them.

For example, here's where you can view/download the one where I'm from (NSW, Australia):  [https://curriculum.nsw.edu.au/custom-view](https://curriculum.nsw.edu.au/custom-view) . Each stage covers two years, e.g. stage 6 is years 11 and 12 in Oz.

While the document might be a bit heavy, the main thing to look for are the content points. For example, here are the dot points for Forces in stage 4 (year 7 and 8) physics:

>Forces in action

>\- Explain forces as either direct (contact) or indirect (non-contact)  
\- Conduct a practical investigation on the effects of a range of direct and indirect forces  
\- Use force diagrams to model balanced and unbalanced forces  
\- Analyse force diagrams to make predictions  
\- Examine the relationship between force and energy  
\- Describe the electrostatic and gravitational forces exerted between objects  
\- Use the concept of forces to describe the motion of objects in orbit  
\- Define weight force as the mass x the acceleration due to gravity (g) (F=mg)  
\- Perform calculations using the equation F=mg to solve for unknowns

Just going by that you can get:

* a bunch of terms to look up (e.g. forces, contact, non-contact, force diagrams, balanced, unbalanced, energy, electrostatic, gravitational, motion, etc),
* an idea of the level of understanding expected at this stage by noting which terms you're expected to relate to each other (e.g. what does motion in orbit have to do with force) along with the verbs used: ""examine"", ""use"", ""identify"", ""describe"", ""explain"",  etc.
* an idea of some activities that students typically engage in (e.g. you might look for some force related experiments online that you can replicate yourself).

Then use this to assess any resources you find. Does the resource cover everything? Is it below/above the expected level? etc.

Note, in school each dot point might translate roughly to an hour or two of material (reading, explanations, examples, exercises, etc)."

Community college will probably be your friend with a high school diploma.  Make sure you're covering those bases."
"I’m a teenager, but was never given a proper education. How do I teach myself?","Well first, I must sincerely applaud you for writing this. It’s a moment of vulnerability and I appreciate you for sharing this, it can't have been easy. And I’d like to highlight that the way you’ve articulated yourself and are introspective of your habits (or perhaps lack thereof) puts you in the upper echelon of most adults, much less high school students. Most people don’t really remember the things they learn nor do they actually care to and this is coming from a college student.

My honest piece of advice: find something you love (preferably STEM-adjacent but it doesn’t have to be) and dedicate yourself to that. A lot of the “real” learning in my experience comes from trying or building and subsequently failing at new things. Heck, more than half the things I know are from projects I’ve done outside of school. Schools these days (even universities) rely on rote-memorization for most topics which doesn’t really work because at that point they're just making you study for an exam rather for a concept, hence the reason most people don't remember much from college. But I digress. . .

Since this is a math subreddit and as a mathematics major a few websites I absolutely adore are:

**Paul's Online Math Notes (https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/)**

* I find his stuff immensely helpful for most things in Algebra and above. If you understand basic arithmetic (operations, variables, basic functions and their properties (e.g. linear, slope, etc.)).
* When you get to Calculus, Differential Equations, and Linear Algebra (which imo you should do all at some point in your life) this website will be a godsend.

**Khan Academy (https://www.khanacademy.org/)**

* The obligatory suggestion. I like his stuff for the most part but not all of it (but for you it's more than fine). The best part is everything is free and most of the content is extremely intuitive.
* I'd say start here, do a few practice quizzes/tests to gauge where your learning is at. From there you can hone in on WHERE to start. Blindly choosing trigonometry when you haven't learned basic algebra is only going to set you back. There is ABSOLUTELY NO SHAME in starting from basics. Most people who fail out of their classes are people who have foundations that absolutely suck.

**Mathispower4u (https://mathispower4u.com/)**

* Is a youtube channel and website run by James Sousa who is a professor at Phoenix College. Super incredible channel with dozens upon dozens of courses with fantastic videos and explanations. I would use his stuff as a supplement to a real professor. I have done this many times quite successfully.

**OpenStax (https://openstax.org/)**

* Is an open resource textbook publisher. They've got some great stuff. I've never used their algebra textbooks but have immensely enjoyed their Calculus series. It's not very rigorous (fairly easy-to-understand) and loaded with good examples and exercises.



These four-sources should pretty easily get you through high school math and even Calculus. Most people including myself would recommend you get a teacher/attend a class, but sitting in a class and taking notes is not for everyone, not to mention good professors are few and far between. But please make a plan for yourself and commit to it. I don't know how you study–only you do. Learning to study (itself) is an art.

Find out what works best for you. And then tailor your plan according to that. Many successful people have homeschooled themselves throughout life. And being able to teach yourself is a gift on levels you can't possibly comprehend right now. I've put some suggestions for other topics but you are probably best served by asking people more knowledgeable than I am in their respective fields:

For English, unless you really really love it, I'd just read a ton. Fiction, non-fiction, Wikipedia (can be unreliable sometimes), comics, etc. I still read quite a bit (although not as much as I should) but it's mostly non-fiction. I've observed that people with the best vernacular and diction are extremely well-read.

Science is tougher because it covers a much broader range than math does. Physics, Chemistry, Biology, etc. They are all big with tons of concentration. Khan Academy is pretty good for this kind of stuff. I was never a great science student though I was (and still am) endlessly fascinated with it.

History, like science, is largely dependent on what you want to study. I think as a good rule of thumb, you should study (presuming you are American) U.S. History. Agrarian and Colonial America, the Declaration, the Constitution, Westward Expansion, Industrialization, Reconstruction, all the big wars (Revolution, Civil, Spanish-American, WWI, WWII, Korean, Vietnam, Cold War). It's increasingly concerning how little most people know about it really. You should also read about the rest of the world lol. Colonialism, Expansion, Silk-Road, Empires, Golden Ages, Renaissance, Enlightenment, Protestant Reformation, etc. You don't NEED to know it, I'm just a huge history buff– and who knows? Maybe one day it'll come in clutch during a trivia competition (definitely NOT speaking from experience ;). r/history are absolute sweethearts for the most part and would be more than happy to help you.

Sorry for the long-winded post, I wrote this on the fly, and I'm sure there are multiple grammatical and (I hope not) conceptual errors. Please feel free to DM me if you'd like. Learning is an incredibly rewarding experience should you let it!


P.S. oh and I forgot. Find a project you'd like to tackle. Start with something challenging yet approachable. It should be something that fascinates you. Learn the tools/skills required and build away! Don't expect to succeed overnight. You can find tons of ideas on the internet. Best of luck!"
"I’m a teenager, but was never given a proper education. How do I teach myself?","As someone twice your age that went through the exact same upbringing, I just want to give you a vote of confidence that you can do it."
"I’m a teenager, but was never given a proper education. How do I teach myself?","I was in the same boat as you. My parents never taught me math growing up (despite demanding good grades) and I had to fend on my own

My mom didn't because she was exhausted from supporting me and my dad's children from a previous marriage, my dad bcos he was a lazy, selfish, SOB

I ended up having to learn on my own. I didn't graduate college until I was in my late 20s (in my thirties now). As for concrete advice: buy textbooks, watch tutorials on YT or places like Khan Academy, print out problems and practice them, and if you can afford it, hire a tutor. Tutoring has helped me out immensely 

Tutors aren't that expensive if you know where to look (Upwork). You can also enroll into community college and take remedial math classes there. Tutoring is free at these schools too"
"I’m a teenager, but was never given a proper education. How do I teach myself?","You use paragraphs in social media, you’ll do great in life"
"I’m a teenager, but was never given a proper education. How do I teach myself?","Bit of context from my experience, learning is a journey and not a race. In the military they often drill the mindset of being an active learner, not that many of the service members do much to enforce that ideology, but it hits the nail right on the head that learning and chasing after curiosity needs to be habitual. 

Don’t get motivated for a couple days, do some Khan Academy, maybe fill out some test forms, watch some YouTube, and then burn out to not continue learning for the next 2-6 months only to repeat this process again in that time. You’ll have accomplished nothing because by the time you implement that knowledge you’ll have forgotten most of it. 

Build up your fundamentals, even if they are boring. Basic multiplication, addition, subtraction. I’m 30 and I still enjoy counting in my everyday life for things like adding up costs, comparing two things as a ratio, turning things into fractions or percentages, counting calories, etc. I may not be a mathematician, but I feel very confident in my analysis skills and ability to quickly come to a fairly close prediction for basic math related things like multiplying large numbers. Remember that for most people math is a tool using your rationality to gain a better understanding of the world around you. It lets you break down things you may not be cognizant of and come to better realizations due to being able to reason and logic through it.

I agree on taking courses, but also, ask yourself interesting questions and see how far you can reason through them. For instance I loved questions like “How far do I travel in a minute going X miles vs Y miles?” growing up because they made me have to move the different values around in my head until things made sense to me. People can explain concepts and ideas to you all day long and you may be able to regurgitate them back to others to seem smarter or more skilled, but being able to objectively look at something, ask yourself some questions, and reason through them to find that answer out at least partially for yourself will take you much further than strictly doing some freebie course and calling it good.

I’m an engineering major so I am versed in many forms of math above basic arithmetic of course, but I only got good at that later math because I had such developed fundamentals. If you enjoy math and want to learn more then as long as you build good habits you’ll naturally learn more and more through your own interests and efforts."
"I’m a teenager, but was never given a proper education. How do I teach myself?",pm me. I'm happy to tutor you for free. Ive been tutoring and teaching for 10-15 years.
"I’m a teenager, but was never given a proper education. How do I teach myself?","pick up books at your level (dont feel ashamed if its not the stuff other 16 year olds read), and find ones you enjoy reading. It's a cheap hobby that'll fill up your reading skills! It's also enjoyable IF you find good books (hence ""find ones you enjoy reading""). 

  
write a journal"
"I’m a teenager, but was never given a proper education. How do I teach myself?","You might think this is old-fashioned, but --- Read actual books.  You learn a lot from reading, and books are different than reading a screen.   It will help build your reading skills, vocabular and spelling, and general knowledge.  And it can be absorbing in a different way than videos.

It's not the answer to everything, but it's a good place to start for general knowledge and skills.

Go to your local library and get a card.  Ask the librarians - -they are there to help and they help all kinds of learners, so don't be embarrassed.   Start with lower-level books if needed, and read books that interest you, and work your way up.  Also read some books that might have been assigned in a classroom-- it's a good indicator of what you should have been learning, or some classics.  Books such as:

The Outsiders

Of Mice and Men

The Most Dangerous Game

To Kill A Mockingbird    --  get more recommendations from a librarian

Or series of books in the Young Adult section --  The Hunger Games, Divergent, Harry Potter, etc.



Of course there are tons of online resources -- videos, etc.   But books are a different way to learn, and once you get used to reading books, it may help how you learn.  Good luck!"

"I’m a teenager, but was never given a proper education. How do I teach myself?","Basic Mathematics, by Serge Lang is pretty good. Also Susan Rigetti has a page So You Want to Study Mathematics. Probably too advanced now, but maybe target as the path ahead."
"I’m a teenager, but was never given a proper education. How do I teach myself?","Some public high schools offer free classes in order to get your GED, they’ll teach you what you need to know to pass the GED tests and then you can apply to community college. In my hometown, my high school was one that offered programs like this. Look at your state’s official education websites and see if you can find information about the possibility."
"I’m a teenager, but was never given a proper education. How do I teach myself?","I'd google search, for example, ""high school cirriculum"" or ""secondary school cirriculum"" and also make use of libre texts (free textbooks online including high school and college level material).

So for math I googled cirriculum and see (unsurprisingly) algebra.

So I google ""libre texts algebra"" and I now have textbooks.

[https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Algebra](https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Algebra)

Pick a book, read a section, and then try to solve the problems. Self learning can be difficult. If you're not sure you're doing a problem correctly you can use youtube (people give step-by-step solutions to similar problems) or kahn academy (which I've had mixed results with, but maybe there is some excellent algebra stuff on it).

Note that in school you don't typically cover every section, and even in the sections you do cover, students aren't required to solve every problem. If you can solve the first few problems of each type in each section you'd be doing well. Also note that although that link shows many textbooks, there is a lot of overlap between beginner/intermediate/advanced algebra.  You really only need to work though 1 or 2 books in the way I described (doing a few problems of each type).

But anyway, for the overall structure, look online for high school / secondary school cirriculums and then look for textbooks. That's my advice.

\--- edit ---

And general advice when asking for help on a specific math or physics problem:

1. Give the whole problem statement exactly as it appears in the book (including any diagrams or tables etc. if that's part of the question).
2. Show your entire attempt at a solution and explain briefly why you thought each step was correct.

This gives the person / group you're asking help from all the tools they need to help you. If you give less than this most people who are capable of helping you will ignore your question."
"I’m a teenager, but was never given a proper education. How do I teach myself?",You can contact your local public school system and ask for resources.. explain your situation and they may even provide a guidance councilor or educator as a go to
"I’m a teenager, but was never given a proper education. How do I teach myself?","YouTube on how to learn how to learn. Seriously, Just watch everything on how to learn and take notes and study. You're doing it wrong, I guarantee you.

 Also remember that the way you learn and study and take notes is going to be different than others. There are 100 ways to takes notes. I learned probably 25 of them off YT in college (maybe 2 in college classes total, one was calculus and the other organic chemistry of all things cus my prof was amazing.), and I made up way number 101 with short hand and symbols that looks like mandarin to others but works perfectly for me."
"I’m a teenager, but was never given a proper education. How do I teach myself?","Not sure where you're situated but if you're looking to get a formal qualification then look into the Cambridge International system. It's popular among homeschoolers because anyone can register to write at a recognized Cambridge school as a private candidate and receive the same qualifications as a full time student. You just buy the textbooks and write the exams. 

I was in a similar situation to you and took this exit route. In the beginning it was very daunting, but the more you get into it the more you realize it's actually not that much you need to learn. A lot of content taught in schools is repeated throughout the years or maybe retaught at higher grades in a slightly more complex way. I'm not saying it won't be difficult at times, but it can be done. 

Personally, I think you're starting from a strong position. You can write well and think critically. You are self-motivated and genuinely interested in learning. These things will carry you a long way. 


In terms of actual learning, in the Cambridge system most IGCSE subjects (that's grade 10-11) start from the very basics, which means you don't require any previous learning to be able to start the textbook from page 1 and understand what's going on from there. The exceptions are maths and English, which do require some basic knowledge. As others have mentioned here, Khan academy is a fantastic resource for building up your maths skills. English you seem to have a good grasp on, but you could probably also find everything you need to know on YouTube. 

My apologies if this is a bit scattered, it's almost 3am where I am. But I just wanted to say, as I said earlier, I've been there. Parents heavily neglected my education and eventually I had to pull up my socks and just get it done myself. Ended up graduating with straight A's and am now working as a teacher and studying maths at uni. I know it's tough and I'm so sorry you were neglected in this way. I know you can get through it, but I also know that while you're going through it it's incredibly daunting and overwhelming at times. So please dm me if you have any questions or you just need support. You've definitely got this person in your corner!"

(I left with a masters for reasons totally unrelated to mathematical ability.) I say all of this, not to brag, but to point out that coming from a non-traditional background can still take you far. I'm currently working as a private math tutor in between office roles. Send me a direct message and let's talk. I can give you some pro bono math assistance. Regardless, hang in there!"

"I’m a teenager, but was never given a proper education. How do I teach myself?","My education ended during fourth grade due to family drama. Like you, I was unsuccessfully homeschooled. Here's my advice:

READ EVERYTHING: It doesn't even matter if it's a textbook. You will learn something from everything you read. Read smart things for sure, but even novels will make you more familiar with language.

GET A JOB: You will learn a lot of real-world skills and meet people who are smarter than you are.

FIND MENTORS: Look for people who exhibit traits you want in your life, and build relationships with them.

TAKE THE GED TEST: You might be surprised how well you do. You probably won't pass the first time, but you'll know what you need to work on to try again.

SIDE NOTE: If you're like me, you might harbor resentment toward your parents later in life. Deal with that early.

Don't think you're destined to fail because of how you were raised. I'm a successful engineer with no formal education. I own a home and have no debt. I've been happily married for 25 years and raised two children to adulthood. I didn't think I'd end up here, but life is full of surprises. Getting started in life is hard, but it gets easier as you build momentum.

Let me know if you have questions,

"I’m a teenager, but was never given a proper education. How do I teach myself?","I feel your pain, not because I was in the same boat, but because I've been in situations where it's felt like I let things go for too long and now I'm embarrassed to address it. As a 28yo with a family, trying to get my Undergrad in EE while working an electronics technician career in the USMC, my best advice is to do exactly what you're doing here. Ask and look! And fuck the embarrassment, because no one knows what they're doing. I'm a Staff Sergeant and I promise at least 50% of the time, I'm still winging it. There's too much to know to be embarrassed about what you don't know. 

Make a list of different resources. I have favorites folders dedicated to websites like Khan Academy, free python textbooks I return to regularly, good classes at OpenMIT that relate to things I'm learning online in my EE. 

Learn about learning styles, and potentially address any ADHD or other learning deficiencies you may have. I have ADHD and I was a TERRIBLE student. Good test taker, but if there was HW or you expected me to do something on my own, it wasn't happening. Now that I'm addressing that and am prescribed Adderall, it feels so easy. Learning styles are super important when you're gonna learn on your own, so figure yours out.

Honestly, I just think I want you to know that NO ONE feels like they know enough. If you can find something you're passionate about learning about and learn what you need to learn as you need it, you'll be as good as anyone else, if not better."
"I’m a teenager, but was never given a proper education. How do I teach myself?","Without fully read your lengthy post, I would say it depends on your ultimate goal.  Are your learning math to meet daily living need (such as buying/selling things, or even an office job), as a prerequisite for other academic pursuance, or to enter into the field of pure mathematical science?  For daily living, you probably can learn it online, but if you want a structured study, you probably need to get a decent school, because mathematical concepts can sometimes be abstract, and you need to interact with teacher to make them clear."
"I’m a teenager, but was never given a proper education. How do I teach myself?","Read books. Seriously. Videos are great and all, but having your brain read the content to you makes a HUGE difference! Reading trains your brain in a different way than passively watching boiled/watered down 20min content."
"I’m a teenager, but was never given a proper education. How do I teach myself?","I personally think that old school textbooks are highly underrated. If you go to [AbeBooks.com](http://AbeBooks.com) you can find just about any textbook for less than $10. Just start with a level where you think you are. If it turns out to be too advanced, buy one level down and save the one you bought before for later. If reading the chapter is sufficient to get you through the practice problems, great. If it isn't, supplement it with youtube. The chapter titles will give you cues on what to search for on youtube and Khan Academy."
"I’m a teenager, but was never given a proper education. How do I teach myself?","Your parents have failed you and are failing you and have a responsibility to do better.  Your writing suggests that you are bright and motivated, even if you don't have follow-through – and as somebody who is the same way, I totally get it.

I don't know if it is possible to get yourself to where you need to be in two years.  Maybe it is, maybe not.

What I do know is that it is not your responsibility.  It is your parents', which they shirked. 

Your first option should be looking at going to the public school for the next two years.  It really depends where you are – if you are very, very lucky, your local school system may be staffed by skilled, caring educators who would jump at the chance to get a bright, motivated student up to grade level rapidly.  But even if not – they are a resource to use.

The good reason to homeschool is when the parents can do a better job than the schools, either because the school system is just baseline terrible, or because the *specific* student does their best learning in situations the parents are better at providing.

The bad reasons to homeschool are any other reason.  

My advice would be to go to the school and have them evaluate you for where you actually are.  Maybe you aren't as far behind as you think you are.  Maybe you are worse off.  And then work with them to develop a plan."
"I’m a teenager, but was never given a proper education. How do I teach myself?","I second Kahn academy and the other resources listed here, and I’ll also note that if your in the states your not too old to join Boy Scouts, which might seem like kinda a wacky suggestion but they have a bunch of really practical projects that are part of it, and the structure might help with the motivation problem. 

I’m pretty adhd so I also have trouble with sticking to things. Groups are your friends. I also would say for some period of the day block compulsive consumption (video games/insta/reddit) and digital fidgeting (Tetris, etc) and then just let yourself pick between whatever more production based practice that feels fun (math practice, drawing practice, music practice)"
"I’m a teenager, but was never given a proper education. How do I teach myself?","Given the late start, is teaching yourself really the best solution? It's not just learning you need, it's some basic qualifications to help you apply for jobs. That would be far easier at some kind of school, college, evening class, online course even.  But something where you will be taught and assessed and helped. 

Or do you already have plans for making a living? If you have a trade or a family business or something then education is in some senses less urgent, but you could focus on things that will help with that. E.g. it may be more useful to select a bookkeeping course than learn algebra. 

Don't be self conscious. It's not your fault you haven't had an education, your parents have let you down. There are plenty of other kids and adults who have missed out on education for whatever reasons - illness, war/refugee status, all sorts. Where I am and I sincerely hope where you are there are options to pick up and mend the gaps in your education at any stage. You don't need to do it on your own and it's never too late."

"I’m a teenager, but was never given a proper education. How do I teach myself?","You need courage, and discipline (planning).
A suggestion:
1. buy a recent 2nd or 1st grade math book (16 years old). This book will be your guide.
2. Read everything (especially the first pages which talk about programs, etc.)
3 When you approach a chapter, read again and immerse yourself in the introduction, then once you have understood the introduction, move on to the course and the exos.

Advice for self-taught people: 
1. In math, you have to answer a single question each time: what is it? Once you have the answer to this question everything becomes clear and you can move on.
2. An answer key read = a ruined exercise.
Don't swallow exos, it's better to be stuck then solve a single exercise.
3. Use and abuse AI (ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.) for every sentence or word you don't understand. Ask for simple examples or use cases, what is a theorem for... Stop consulting these AI once you understand.
Consider that you have at your disposal around ten teachers available 24/7, to whom you can ask the same question 50 times, to rewrite the course of the book, etc. In addition, they do not judge you.
4. Be Zen and forget about time (A.Wiles took 7 years to prove Fermat's theorem).
5. It is very difficult at the beginning to respect this rigor and everything is difficult. But one day, you don't even realize, you can't go a day without touching math. I repeat: forget about time because it confuses your mind.

Good luck and you will need it (only at the beginning)."

If you can I'd also recommend looking at volunteer opportunities with various programs. It's a good way to pick up job experience, and depending on where you there maybe programs that might help finance you towards college. 

Unfortunately, your biggest problem is likely going to discipline and motivation. Learning is work, and some at level your just going to have to cultivate the habit for being willing to dig in and grind. On that front you could always try to pick up some mediation, specifically breath awareness meditation tends to be good on that front, so I'd highly recommend it if you can.

Kind of.

I don't know who exactly came up with this definition that if we consider multiplication as repeated addition: 3\*5 = 5 + 5 + 5.

The first number is considered to be the multiplier and the second number is considered the multiplicand. We consider 3\*5 to mean that we have 3 fives. 

Why do we do it that way?  I'm not really sure - but it's the standard convention. Because of the commutative property we know that 3\*5 = 5\*3 = 15, but 3\*5 is interpreted as ""3 sets of five"" and  5\*3 is interpreted as ""5 sets of three.""    Is it 15 objects in both cases?  Absolutely.

i think you may not actually grasp the difference yet, because it turns out that the set of rational numbers and the set of integers have the same cardinality (even though the set of rational numbers has all the fractions). the point is, traditional reasoning about size of sets goes out the window when you talk about infinite sets.

in fact, we can create a bijection between the integers and the rational numbers! [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational\_number#Countability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number#Countability)

furthermore, we *cannot* create a bijection between the integers and the real numbers (see the classic Cantor's diagonal argument: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s\_diagonal\_argument). while there are both infinitely many integers and infinitely many real numbers, the set of real numbers has a larger cardinality"
Infinities with different sizes,"> logically if there are infinite fractions between each integerz then the number of integers should be less than the number of real numbers.

You might think that, but logic (by carefully defining what it means to talk about the ""size"" of an infinite set) has shown otherwise.

That brings us to your second question....  

For finite sets, an easy way to tell that they are the same size (cardinality) is that we can pair them up - if there are n people in a room and m chairs and I can seat them so every person has a chair and every chair has a person, then n = m.

For infinite sets, they are said to have the same cardinality if we can pair up  the elements of the two sets (ie create a one-to-one map).  And it turns out that you can have cases where a subset of an infinity set can be put into a one-to-to relationship with the entire set (mind-bending but true), and integers and fractions is one case where that happens: the set of integers and the set of fractions are *equal* in cardinality - ""there are as many integers as there are fractions"".  I can even give a good description of the one-to-one mapping."
Infinities with different sizes,"
> I understand the concept behind larger / smaller infinities - logically if there are infinite fractions between each integerz then the number of integers should be less than the number of real numbers.

Seems like you do not understand the concept very well.

There aren't more fractions than integers. It's the irrational numbers (not fractions!) that make up the larger infinity.

> But my problem with it is that how can you compare sizes of something that is by it's very nature infinite in size?

The same way you compare the finite sets. 

You check if you can pair up the elements of both sets, i.e., if there is a bijection between them. If yes, then the sets are of the same size, otherwise they are not.

For the sets that are not of the same size, you see which one **necessarily** have elements left over when you attempt to pair up the elements of the two sets. The one that **always** has elements left over is bigger.

[That's simply not true.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument)

Again, that's simply not true. (For the same reason as above.)

You need to admit to yourself that you do not at all understand the concept you claim to understand in the first paragraph and focus on actually learning the relevant concepts.

Start by learning about the notion of injective, surjective, and bijective functions. Continue by learning how those concepts are used to define what it means or two sets to have the same number of elements, and for one set to have a larger number of elements than another. Once you learn and understand those things, all the confusion will go away."
Infinities with different sizes,"> For every real number there should be an integer for them, since the number of integers is also infinite.

No! This was commonly thought to be the case but Cantor famously proved that this is not true.

Read up on [Cantor's diagnoalization argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument) if you haven't already, but essentially, if you claim to have produced a mapping between the integers and the reals, I can always construct at least one real number that you ""missed"". I do this by taking the first number in your list and changing its first digit, taking the second number and changing its second digit, taking the third number and changing its third digit, etc. I'll end up with a valid real number that neccesarily can't be any of the ones in your list, because it's different than all of them in at least one digit.

This was a surprising and counter-intuitive result, but it's true! There really are different ""sizes"" of infinities."
Infinities with different sizes,"Two sets A and B are said to be the same “cardinality” if there exists a perfect matching (the more formal word is bijection) between the elements of A and the elements of B.  An illustration would be the sets A = {1,2,3,4,5} and B = {6,8,90,424,5555}.  One matching is 1 — 6, 2 — 90, 3 — 5555, 4 — 8, 5 — 424.

This definition works out well in that we can compare infinite sets this way.  The sets A={1,2,3,4,5,…} and B={2,4,6,8,…} have the same cardinality because the matching n — 2n works.   The harder part is writing down the details behind why this is a perfect matching.  

Notice in the example above that B is a proper subset of A, so it looks like it should be “smaller”.  One feature of any infinite set X is that there exists a proper subset Y such that Y and X have the same cardinality.  A simple construction is to remove one element from X to produce Y.  

The main breakthrough in this subject was by Georg Cantor who showed that there is no perfect matching between N = {1,2,3,4,5,…} and the set R of real numbers; any attempt to match the elements of N with those of R must fail to use all of the elements of R.  It is clear that N is a subset of R, so in this sense, N is strictly smaller than R even though both sets are infinite."
Infinities with different sizes,"There are different dimensionalities to infinites. The integers are an infinite number of finite steps. The larger infinities come when you break down the space into infinite steps and each one of those steps is also infinite. Not only can't you finish counting, you can't even begin.

Cardinality is the nature of a set in terms of its countability or the ability to have some mapping onto the basic integer sequence. Some sets can't be ""counted in a row"" like one end to the other. It's not always obvious which are or aren't countable infinities.

And there are multiple layers of removal from uncountable, not just the binary yes/no."
Infinities with different sizes,">how can you compare sizes of something that is by it's very nature infinite in size?

The point is that we want to *define* rigorous ways to compare the sizes of infinite sets, more usefully than just saying “they’re both infinite”. And there are many ways to do that.

Cardinality is one way—it’s what you get when you define equal size as “each element of one can be paired with each element of the other, without any left over”. And by this measure, there are fewer integers than reals, because no matter how you pair them up, there will always be more reals left over.

Another way is “arithmetic density”, which tries to give a rigorous meaning for intuitions like “half of all positive whole numbers are even, so the even subset should be half the size of the entire set”. The two sets E = {2, 4, 6, …} and P = {1, 2, 3, …} have the same *cardinality* because we can pair them with none left over using a relation like [*e* = 2*p*]. But for any given threshold *n*, they have different numbers of elements below that threshold, and as *n* grows large, the ratio of those sizes approaches (1/2). More formally: lim [*n* → +∞] (|{*e* ∈ E | *e* < *n*}| / |{*p* ∈ P, *p* < *n*}|) = (1/2).

>For every real number there should be an integer for them, since the number of integers is also infinite.

You’d think so! Georg Cantor proved that *even though* they’re both infinite, one is still somehow bigger than the other. It’s surprising, and even a lot of mathematicians at the time were unsettled by it.

If you think of the natural numbers including zero, there’s obviously a way to list them: [0, 1, 2, 3, …]. There’s also a way to list all the integers, by starting from zero and alternating signs: [0, +1, −1, +2, −2, …]. A bit surprisingly, you can even do this for fractions, by also including their reciprocals [0; 1/1; 1/2, 2/1; 1/3, 3/1; 2/3, 3/2; 1/4, 4/1; 3/4, 4/3; …], or by listing each possible sequence of decimal digits, with each possible position for a decimal point. But with the reals, you can start with 0 or any value you choose, and you can’t even begin to list what comes next."
Infinities with different sizes,"It doesn't sound like you have been exposed to any really solid explanation of this topic before. It is evident from the misconceptions in your post.

No, this is not the reasoning. The rationals have this property and have the same cardinality as the naturals. This is a property of an *ordering*, not of the size of a set.

> how can you compare sizes of something that is by it's very nature infinite in size? 

Directly through the definition. Do you know the definition of cardinality? Then you just need to start doing some exercises and actually comparing the cardinalities of some infinite sets. That's the only way to get comfortable with the notion."
Infinities with different sizes,"You're asking good questions. What does it mean that two ""infinities"" are equal or different? By an infinity we really mean the size (cardinality) of a set.  Two sets are said to have the same cardinality if we can put the elements of each in a 1:1 correspondence.  

Showing an apparently bigger set is the same cardinality as an apparently smaller one is often a case of some clever coding to create that correspondence.  

You've had a few good explanations already so I'd just like to mention - look up Hilbert's hotel. It's a cool thought experiment giving you some insight into how intuition about finite sets doesn't necessarily transfer to infinite ones. 

If you have any set at all, say S, and you want to create one with a bigger cardinality, you can consider its power set: the set consisting of all subsets of S."
Infinities with different sizes,"Two thingd have the same size if you can create a 1:1 mapping between their elements. It doesn't matter if your could create other mappings, so long as a 1:1 mapping exists. 

You can create such a mapping for rational numbers to reals. One way is to list every integer along an x axis and list them again along the y axis (you can i clide negatives by alternating theme with thr positives). Then make a division table between them tonfind every possible x/y representation of rational numbers. 

Then you can order them by zig zagging through this list. That's an ordering between the natural numbers and rational numbers.

But if we try to do this for the real numbers, we fail. 

Let's assume we have a list of every real number between 0 and 1. 

Then we go down the list, and add it's nth digit +1 to a new number. This creates a real number that differs from every number on our list in at least one digit. Therefore it's a real number between 0 and 1 that's not on our list of all real numbers between 0 and 1 , which is a contradiction. Therefore, you cant map the natural numbers to the reals, therr are even more reals than natural numbers. It's uncountable infinite, while the naturals are countable infinite."

Anything you don't get 100% on, review it until you do, then take the Course Challenge Again.  Start low, Pre-Algebra.  You can also go from 'have a basic grasp of the material' to 'am adept at using the material' by using the AOPS Alcumus question bank (start after you've done Pre-Algebra in Khan) and work your way up to 'green' or even 'blue' in all skills up through Pre-Calc.  Since you want to do a math degree, don't skip the Number Theory or the Probability and Counting sections, do those too.  Those all require tricky and creative application of the skills you're being taught in Khan and supplemented elsewhere.  Don't give up easily because mathematics is about having a tricky problem and then solving it creatively, and then proving what you've done.

Beyond that, you can also 'read ahead' in Khan to get to Calc 2 and 3, Linear Algebra - do those if you have time so you won't be faced with all brand new material in class.  Also get the book called 'How to Prove It' (or a similar one) to better understand proofs, because advanced mathematics requires you prove things - advanced mathematics isn't being a *user* of mathematics, it's being a *creator* of mathematics and when you create math you have to prove it.

During your now-limited free time you can read about various proofs in mathematical history, understanding how people have come up with math and try when you can to come up with your own. Mathematics at the advanced level - pure math particularly - is an art.

Most people have never been exposed to true mathematics, in the sense of the puzzle-solving creation of mathematics.  Maybe a dash of it in geometry, but even then it was half-hidden.  Good luck!"
Need Advice on Passing Analysis 1 (Retaking While Also Taking Analysis 2),"Memorize all the definitions exactly.   Make sure you understand the meanings of each definition.  Make sure you can come up with examples of things that fit each definition and things that don't.   Play around with the definitions and make sure, if you're given something new, you know how to apply the definition to determine if the new thing is an example of the defined term or not.

Make sure you understand the statement of every theorem.  Develop a collection of counterexamples.  For example, if a Theorem says that ""If A and B and C hold, then D must hold"", then make sure you are aware of counterexamples where, say, A and B hold, C doesn't hold, and D also doesn't hold.    And look for another example where A and C hold, B doesn't hold, and D also doesn't hold.  And so on.   In other words, make sure you understand in such a situation why A, B, and C are all necessary conditions in the Theorem.   Do this for every theorem and every important lemma.  

Get as much practice as you can applying the theorems to problems.  On an exam everything will be jumbled up together, so you might have a problem where you could use the Mean Value Theorem, but the problem won't tell you that.   So if you can, write down problems on seperate pieces of paper and then practice picking out problems to do where you have no idea what section they were from.

Play around, try to come up with your own questions.  Also, see if you can find old exams or problem sets on the same material, not necessarily even from the class you are taking.   Just search the topics and look online for problems to work on when you've done all the ones in the book.

When you are stuck on a problem, let yourself remain stuck for awhile (hours at least, or days if you can afford it).  When you look up an answer, you are robbing yourself of the opportunity to figure it out yourself.  And the best way to get better at problem solving is to force yourself to actually solve the problems and not just try to understand someone else's solutions."

Besides that, as another user has already suggested, if you want to introduce a number then you need to say how it works with other parts of arithmetic as well. Ideally, it would obey all or most of all the usual laws (and if it doesn’t obey some, then we need some kind of structure left). On top of that, you probably need to answer “why is this helpful?”"
"Well, r/math said this was more fit for here, anyway i made a way to solve x÷0","This is somewhat tangential, but plenty of rings have what are called zero divisors: numbers x, y which aren't equal to zero yet xy = 0.

Dovision on the go for practical everyday application.,"We all break things down differently. This is how my brain handles approximating 7000/450.

3. 7000-5000=2000 so I can get another four 500s out of that 7000. My approximation is now 14 (getting closer).
4. But we were dividing by 450 not 500. 14×50=7×100=700. So I can have 14 items that are worth 450 and still have 700 over.
5. I can get one more 450 out of the 700 and have 250 left over. This is enough for a little over half an item so 7000/450 is a little over 15.5. If I need more accuracy I'm breaking out pen and paper or a calculator."

Is there a rule that any “error” divide by the same “error” will equal 1?,"Imaginary numbers are quite different from other ""errors"" like division by zero. They are actually extremely well behaved and it is a shame people called them imaginary numbers because they are actually very useful.

For division by zero, you cant really cancel out things like (1/0)/(2/0). Not because they are different infinities or anything, but because if you do things like that you can usually rearrange things to get something like 1=2 which is obviously false. In some cases division by zero is thought of as infinity, but the rules for this are a bit strict and its not as flexible or nice as imaginary numbers."
Is there a rule that any “error” divide by the same “error” will equal 1?,"i is not an error, it is a different type of number. A calculator will give an error when typing the sqrt(-1) if it has not been programmed to understand imaginary numbers, but imaginary numbers are an incredibly useful tool. We can perform i/i as the imaginary numbers are a well-defined field and all of these properties work nicely, however this is not true of other types of operations that are ill-defined on the real numbers.

  
Your example of 1/0 is a good one as it is also undefined on the real numbers. You can create a new number to be equal to 1/0 and this leads you to different number systems. Depending on how you define this new system, (1/0)/(2/0) may be a valid expression or it may not, it depends on the specific definitions you choose. Unfortunately, these systems are not nearly as useful as imaginary numbers and can often break properties of the real numbers. So you don't see these numbers used very often but generally it is an interesting exercise to try and define a consistent definition of these types of undefined numbers.

  
TLDR: an operation resulting in an error on the calculator simply means it is not defined on the real number line. You can always make a new number system where you do get a valid output, but most of these number systems are inconsistent and/or not useful so are not brought up much. Imaginary numbers are the best example as this as they are consistent and super useful."

Is there a rule that any “error” divide by the same “error” will equal 1?,"Math gets really specific/pedantic for reasons like this, exactly. Dividing by 0 doesn't give an 'error,' specifically the result is ""undefined."" I think the term gets thrown around a lot in math, but it means exactly what it says - a result being ""undefined""  means ""the mathematical structure we are working in has no definition for how this operation evaluates."" As such, there's no way to create rules for handling interactions between undefined expressions, because the system we're working in explicitly doesn't know what they are.

i is definitely confusing here, because you initially learn that the square root of a negative is undefined only to later learn that it actually *is* defined in terms of i. However, the square roots of negatives *are* undefined when working only with the set of real numbers and are only defined when working within the set of complex numbers, where i is defined. It's not the rules changing, it's the framework/field that you're working in expanding with new numbers and new rules for defining them.

In that way, you could hypothetically come up with a different framework with its own rules for handling division by 0 or any other undefined function, but you would need to explicitly define how those functions are handled and handle the consequences it has for how other operations work. E.g. by proving whether or not associativity, commutativity, reflexivity, etc. still hold true"
Is there a rule that any “error” divide by the same “error” will equal 1?,"1/0 is not a meaningful expression in mathematics. It doesn't make sense to incorporate it in an expression.

i, on the other hand, is not an ""error"", but a well-defined mathematical object.

You *can* assign a value to 1/0 in certain contexts, for example you can extend the real line to contain ∞ (this is called a *one-point* *compactification* of the real line). But in this case ∞/∞ remains an undefined operation."
Is there a rule that any “error” divide by the same “error” will equal 1?,"Generally no.


Outside of limits, (1/0) / (1/0) is actually 0/0 which is also undefined.


Within limits, it isn't as clear but it's not always 1. For example, let me define Lim(x) as taking the limit as x goes to 0. Lim(1/x) is undefined because, as x goes to 0, 1/x goes to infinity.


The Lim(1/x)/Lim(1/x) is equal to Lim((1/x)/(1/x)) which here will equal to 1, even though both individually go to 1/0. 


However Lim(1/x)/Lim(1/x^2 ) has the same form if you don't use the multiplication rule for limits (1/0 divided by 1/0) but combining them shows that the limit is actually 0. If you switch them, you still get 1/0 or infinity.


So, no matter whether you're talking limits or normal math, (1/0) / (1/0) does not have a specific answer - without limits it's still dividing by zero, with limits it depends on how fast the 0s approach 0."

Is there a rule that any “error” divide by the same “error” will equal 1?,The answer is no. 1/0 is not defined and cannot ne multiplied by 0/1 to obtain 1
Is there a rule that any “error” divide by the same “error” will equal 1?,"The reals don’t contain a definition for the square root of a negative real. This is what I figure you mean by an “error”. We can *extend* the reals to the complex numbers by adding the imaginary unit i, as a “formal” square root of −1.

When we do this, we typically try to *define* as many of the familiar rules of algebra as possible without making the system inconsistent. So it’s not that any extension *must* allow [*x*/*x* = 1], it’s that one of our *goals* when we define a new number system is to allow rules like [*x*/*x* = 1], possibly with some “side conditions” like [*x* ≠ 0].

For example, when extending the reals to the complex numbers, we can keep the rule [√(*a*)√(*b*) = √(*ab*)], but only if we add the side conditions [*a* ≥ 0] and [*b* ≥ 0].

Many extensions are just useless because they imply things like [1 = 0], essentially giving a number system with only one number.

In other extensions like [wheel algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_theory) where we can divide by 0, we lose some nice rules like [0*x* = 0] and [*x*/*x* = 1], but this may still be useful sometimes—it’s just less versatile than the complex numbers where we don’t have to give up as much, so it’s less often used."
Is there a rule that any “error” divide by the same “error” will equal 1?,"My history knowledge is by no means perfect, so anyone feel free to correct this.

I believe what you're talking about is the fact that when trying to find the roots of a general 3rd degree polynomial, Cardano ran into the problem that some of his solutions would contain sqrt(-1) or just the square root of some negative number, which at the time was undefined. Here it's important to understand that here undefined means that we didn't have a way to interpret what sqrt(-1) even means, in other words the quantity wasn't defined. What Cardano then noticed is that if we suppose that sqrt(-1) was some value and you complete the calculations ignoring the fact that it had undefined term, then you could still get roots of the polynomial."

Is there a rule that any “error” divide by the same “error” will equal 1?," I want to go back to something you said in explaining the thinking behind the question. It may be true that (1/0)/(1/0)=1but if it is that won't be because it is infinity over  infinity and cancels. Lots more complicated than that unfortunately. Here comes the maths bit, concentrate. 
Defining addition and multiplication for the natural numbers or counting numbers or positive integers is not trivial and although they can be extended to include the rational numbers or fractions, until you have defined them you can't assume that they add and multiply at all and you certainly can't assume any algebraic laws for them. The correct way to go involves as a start considering ordered pairs of natural numbers (a,B)
For example (2,3) or (1,10) ,But that's only a start. The next step is to define equality for these objects. Your knowledge of fractions should include the fact that 12/3= 4/1. 
Corresponding to that homely example we can simply define two different ordered pairs with different particular natural numbers inside the brackets as equivalent if a.d. =b.c.
Where X =(a,B) and Y =(c,d) 
And using . To represent multiplication for natural numbers 
This will ensure that (8,6) is equivalent to (4,3). I am assuming you know what an ordered pair is in set theory. The next bit is even cleaver.  I have said equivalent rather than equal. And the relation as defined is what mathematicians call an equivalence relation. These can be shown to partition the set of all ordered pairs into different sets. At this point I should prove first of all that the relation I defined is an equivalence relation. Then you can prove the partition claim. Every ordered pair belongs to exactly one of the equivalence classes defined by the relation. This is not hugely difficult but it is more than I want to do just now. We still need to define other things for these ordered pairs or equivalence classes of ordered pairs. For example is the class as to which (5,6) belongs greater than or less than (3,4)?
I am not going to tell you but my point is that to this point that has been given no meaning. We can define it in terms of relations between representatives of the equivalence classes.  there's a similar story for operations such as addition and multiplication. We can define them for our newly created entities but until we have done so we can't assume anything about them 
We can define the sum of two of these numbers by saying that if (a,B) is a representative of the first number and (c,d) is a representative of the second number then(a. d+BC,BD is a representative of their sum. If I have got it right it should correspond  to rules you were taught in early mathematics classes. What I have tried to sketch out will enable you to compare some fractions with others and also do some simple calculations with them but one would still need to prove connections between the order relations and arithmetic. For example is it the case that one fraction will be greater than another if and only if the first is equal to the sum of the second one and another non-negative fraction and is that in turn equivalent to the first being equal to the second times a number greater than 1. You may think this is a lot of work. Strictly speaking we should do more. Firstly we'd need to show that addition and multiplication as defined have various properties. First of all did I write down the correct definition of addition. ? If not can we tweak it so that 1/4+1/12= 3/12+1/12=4/12 =1 /3 ?  You are right I should have used ordered pairs rather than using the slash sign for division( a ratio  between two numbers is a new entity and not simply the result of doing the division within the natural numbers we can also adapt early school rules into a definition of multiplication and  show it gives me expected results. But there's still more. we should prove at the very least that these new operations in our new class of numbers are closed or rather that our set is closed under the operations. Part of the definition will have to be that in (a,B) B must be not 0.i.e.  we can't define fractions in a way that allows the equivalent of dividing by zero. And  this is not an arbitrary rule but is needed to ensure overall consistency  it is  then necessary to prove that with such a condition the sum of two fractions is also always a fraction and similarly for multiplication. Only after all that do you get to do fun stuff such as proving that both operations are commutative but hopefully that follows from the corresponding law for the natural numbers I wonder if by error you realise you can't assume laws of algebra such as cancellation for things like fractions involving 0 but you aren't sure of a  a proper way to deal with them. That hunch guided my answer as set out I would urge you not to think along the lines of error numbers cancelling.. obviously given what I said it can't be right to say that one over zero equals one over zero so the first divided by second equals one. Moreover the proper approach will show things that you can't prove  for example one over 0 will  be equivalent to 2/0 and even 10 / 0
You included in your question and it's motivation  the complex numbers or at least one of them. It is a long road from the rational numbers to the reals but it can be done and is worth understanding. Once you have got the real numbers you can extend those to the complex numbers. It's ordered pairs all over again but different rules for addition and multiplication 
Very roughly addition corresponds to treating a complex number as a vector made up from a real part and the imaginary part and then defining a vector addition in terms of the parts. It will be different from the fractions case in terms of the formula we use.  the real part of the sum of two complex numbers is the sum of each of their real parts and similarly for the imaginary part 

In brief I don't think there's any rule like what you suggest and in fact that would just be a lazy ad hoc way of avoiding problems. Dealing with numbers properly is harder work but has an inner logic that ensures that the system is consistent and follows certain known patterns and pathways 
Ordered pairs are used elsewhere and I have seen equivalence classes described as the secret weapon of mathematics because it is such a powerful technique in several different branches of mathematics 
I or the Square root of minus 1is not a variable it is a constant like 2or5or 10. Perhaps what you meant or someone who said that assuming that you can cancel them in the same way as the laws of algebra meant was simply a way of warning you of dangers without getting into details. Having set out only a crude sketch of some details I can understand why some people might want to avoid them"
Is there a rule that any “error” divide by the same “error” will equal 1?,"There is no such thing as ""solving"" or ""not solving"" a number.  Numbers just are.  Equations with unknown variables can be solved for the variable.

You have to define terms carefully, otherwise you get into confusions like this.  sqrt(-1) is not intrinsically meaningful at all.  You have to say what you mean by this in order to have a meaningful number.

If sqrt(-1) means ""the real number which, when squared, is -1"" then it is undefined because such a number does not exist.

If sqrt(-1) means ""the complex number which, when squared, is -1"" then it is not sufficiently defined because there are two such numbers: i and -i.

It may be a heuristic to say that i = sqrt(-1) but that is not technically correct.  i is a number that we augment the real numbers by, satisfying i^(2)=-1.  Just as you might take the natural numbers and augment it by the number -1.  In both cases, if you add this number then in order to satisfy closure properties, you also have to add more numbers.

For complex numbers you have to further add every number of the form a+bi.

If you take the natural numbers and augment by -1, then you also have to include -2, and -3, and so on, and the end result is that this produces the integers.

In this way, the complex numbers are no more mysterious or philosophically different than the integers."

The math isn't too difficult to follow and some calculus is needed to figure out the CDF from the PDF is the integral of an exponential (pretty much the simplest integral). The pi comes about because the PDF must have a total probability of all events = 1 (this has to be true for a complete probability space) and pi normalizes the integral so that this happens. The e comes about because we have something like f(a + b) = f(a)f(b) and only the exponential function has this property. 

And using the Central Limit Theorem, sampling a non symmetric pdf will result in the SAMPLE distribution being normally distributed too. (\* the proof is easily found on the internet too)"
Derivation/Motivation behind statistical distributions,">ie it feels like theyre taking kinda arbitrarily functions with insane mathematical formulae which turn out to have these unique properties

It's the other way around. You start with the properties, and then you can figure out a PDF for the distribution with those properties. Often it will end up looking a bit weird, but that's fine."

What is 0^0?,"> I don't care about man made rules

All math is man made rules.

> If it isn't empirical, it isn't real -- that's my philosophy

If it requires empirical evidence then it is no longer math. Math is self contained in it's axioms and thus independent of any real world relation, though one can say that some axioms are somewhat inspired by real life observations. But no matter, i will still try to explain, first with easy example and then with a more complicated one.

Start with fixing some base number, let's say 10 cookies also written as 10\^1. You can think of exponentiating say 10\^2 as meaning ""for every cookie i have i will turn it into a stack of 10 cookies"" then you have 100. Then going from 10\^2 to 10\^1 means that for every stack of 10 cookies i can make, i will take 1 cookie, leaving you with 10. Then following this logic 10\^0 means that you have 10 cookies and for every stack of 10 you take 1, leaving you with 10\^0=1. Where 0\^0 then breaks down is that we should take that as ""for every stack of 0 i can make i will take 1"" but you already have 0 so the question is if 0 cookies make 1 stack of 0 cookies or if the question is nonsense?

The much more complicated example is thinking of integer exponentiation a\^b to mean how many functions can i find from a set with b-many elements to a group with a-many elements. For example mapping 3 elements to 2 elements can be done in 8=2\^3 different ways. The question is then if a,b both have 0 elements, then the question becomes ""How many functions exist that map the empty set to the empty set?"". Again some people would say 1 such function exists and others would say that the question is nonsense.

I hope this helped."

Where should I start with self studying math?,"Start with a solid review of basic algebra. Make sure you really understand topics like solving equations, working with expressions, and basic functions. Once you are comfortable, move on to topics in geometry and then more advanced topics such as sequences and series. Using a resource like Khan Academy is a good idea because it offers clear lessons and plenty of practice exercises. Khan Academy is widely used in schools and by self-study for its step-by-step approach 



It is important to work regularly on problems and review topics frequently. If you struggle with retention, try to explain what you learned in your own words or teach it to someone else. This practice is supported by research in learning strategies and has helped many students improve their understanding.

Struggled in Discrete Math -- Was it a lack of talent or just poor mindset (or both)?,"Sounds like it was your mathematical abilities given the mindset. You hamnstrung yourself trying to memorize everything. That rarely works in more challenging courses. 
It's impossible to memorize every problem."
Struggled in Discrete Math -- Was it a lack of talent or just poor mindset (or both)?,"Discrete math is *supposed* to do that to most people. It's most students' first foray into real abstraction and proof-based constructions of anything. It's not like other classes that are heavily calculation-based where you can put some formulas in your tool bag as starting points and then rely on being good at algebra (see: most ""gifted"" students' first forays into calculus I and II). Obviously it's disappointing to fail, but that doesn't mean it's over for you. Whether it's one problem at a time or one course at a time, learning new things is supposed to challenge you and you'll fail eventually. You're making a big deal philosophizing about your self-worth for something that's... pretty normal.

Discrete math, more than any math class you've taken before, will require doing the thing yourself. You don't have proof muscles like you have algebra muscles; just following along with the book or lecture notes isn't going to be enough. You've got to be an active participant to develop your skills to the point where certain steps can become trivial.

All of this means that Pre-Calc is totally doable by a high schooler, and so is Calc 1.  You also CAN study pre-calc adequately on your own or online, it isn't rocket science though it'll push some more advanced concepts.  If you're worried about the quality of the coursework you can supplement by doing AOPS Alcumus Intermediate Algebra and Pre-Calc questions from their free, large, super high quality and very difficult bank.

Sequences and Series Help,"It is totally normal to be lost at this point. But the goal of series is to express functions as convergent power series. One you get there, all derivatives and integrals are as simple as the power rule."
Sequences and Series Help,Which part are you stuck on?
Sequences and Series Help,"Well the good news is that they are totally different, so your intuition isn't so far off.


Think of a sequence like a function.  Only thing is that a sequence can only take positive whole numbers as inputs.  This makes the graph a ""bunch of dots"" rather than a continuous curve.  Sequences converge if the dots all get closer together the larger n becomes. The function version of this is having a horizontal asymptote. 


Think of a series as like integrating a sequence.  Specifically an improper integral from 0 (or 1, depending on the first input for the sequence) to infinity.  It's what you get by adding up all the terms of the sequence.  The catch is that there are infinitely many terms, so you can't just ""do the math"" to add up the terms.  Hence the theorems. 


When it comes to calc II, as long as you haven't gotten to power series yet and are just dealing with series of numbers (sections 11.2 - 11.6 of Stewart calc) the bulk of the work comes down to convergence testing series to see if they ""add up"" to a finite number (meaning they converge) or fail to add up to a finite number (meaning they diverge). 


Good rules for calc II students struggling here: 


banish the word ""it"" from your vocabulary.  When referring to a series ""it"" could be the full infinite series, could be a partial sum of that series, could be the sequence of terms for the series, or could be some other related object in a convergence test.  No more ""it"" ; if you want to refer to something, call it explicitly what it is.  That's tip number 1.


Tip number 2: you must know the definitions, all of them, exactly.  And you must know all of the convergence tests (the ""if"" stuff and the ""then"" stuff) exactly.  I don't care how.  Practice problems and check the work against known good solutions, use flash cards, have your friend or partner quiz you on the exact language... Whatever works for you.  But you simply cannot succeed at using a tool you if don't even know what the tool does. 


Tip number 3: write all of the work.  All of the steps.  Every time.  Good notation.  Write words between the math symbols explaining why and what is going on.  Nothing is done or left ""in your head"".  See the banishing of the word ""it"" above - - it does not converge, the series converges.  It does not have a limit, the sequence has a limit.  Imagine you're writing for someone who has no clue what you're trying to do.  This is how math people think, and it's how we write. 


Tip number 4: For series convergence tests, make a flow chart showing what tests to use in what order and how to chose which test to use on each series.  I'll dig up one from an old student and edit it in here if your like, but the making of your own is important, cause that's what Wil actually help you remember. 


Tip 5: mentioned earlier, but solve effing problems.  All of them. Or all that you possibly can.  Dozens.  Hundreds.  And have someone who knows wtf they are doing check over as much of your work as possible. 


Tip 6: experiment.  Take some of those problems and use software like wolfram alpha or whatever to compute a bunch of partial sums.  I have a desmos tool for plotting partial sums of series here: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qtp4lhxk3i. You will have to understand what's going on there to get anything out of it, but it's not too complicated.  The main idea with series is that they converge if and only if their sequence of partial sums is a convergent sequence.  This means you must master sequences to have a hope with series.  Once you understand sequences reasonably well, look at the definition of a partial sum. It's really not that complicated.  


Hope this helps.  Feel free to ask specific questions.  I teach this class a lot, and it's kinda my baby. "
Sequences and Series Help,"The chapter is actually made of several different skills, so it's better to be specific about what the issue is. Do you not like that (1/2) + (1/4) + (1/8) + ... adds up to something finite? Did you forget a series is just a sequence with different notation, so you can just take the limit? Did you just have trouble with the convergence tests or Taylor series and just decide you didn't understand anything?

Sequences are just: it's a list of numbers. You take limits the same way as before. You should know the monotone theorem. That's basically it. Was there an exercise you had an issue with?"
How to learn form scratch?,there are plenty of books and videos. no need to start over from scratch.
How to learn form scratch?,"You start back where you were certain that you mastered the content, and then progress one step at a time.  Generally people recommend Khan Academy for the progression if you're self-learning as a hobby since it's all set up for you and is free.  Go back to Grade 4 and take the Course Challenge twice which will identify if you have any gaps.  If you find any, do those units to mastery (100%) and take the Challenge again.  Then go onto Grade 5 and do the same thing, and so on and so on until you get as far as you want to go (can teach yourself Calc 2 if you want from Khan for example).

Khan has a mix of videos and exercises, and while I don't think it's a perfect replacement for a full course, as practice volume is a touch light, there are somewhat fewer edge cases discussed and there's a lack of multi-skill integration and application, it's a fantastic program for the self-learner.  Make sure you get \~100% on anything you don't already know solidly.

If you do want to elevate the depth of your understanding, you can supplement Khan starting from Pre-Algebra with the AOPS Alcumus question bank.

- all expenses shown are supposed to be common expenses
- the initial $1000/person was paid upfront to B
- the overspend is to be allocated equally per person

There are 8 people so initially 8000 was paid to B (including B's own contribution from private funds). The total spent was 9344.78, so the initial fund was overspent by 1344.78, or 168.0975 per person.

A spent 2464.76, of which 4×168.0975=672.39 they owe towards the overspend, so they're owed 1792.37.

B spent 6508.13, out of 8000+2×168.0975 that they should have spent, so they owe 1828.065 to the others.

C spent 371.89 of which they owed 336.195 to the overspend, so they are owed 35.695.

These values add to zero as they should.

So B pays 1792.37 to A, and B pays 35.695 to C. How to deal with the half cent is left as an exercise for the reader.

"Ai doesn't get it right, please help with this math problem",The way I would think about this is just take each family in turn. as I read the set up it looks to me like no family spent more than they had put in.

why does continuity correction work,You always make the correction so that the calculated area gets larger
why does continuity correction work,"It's because continuous distribution functions don't give us probabilities, just probability densities. For a normally distributed random variable, the probability for it to be exactly the mean is 0 because the integral over a point (the mean in this case) is 0, even if the integrated function has its maximum at that point. So if we didn't do a correction, the normal approximation of, say, a binomial distribution would give a probability of 0 for any given result. Meanwhile, a normal distribution would give a nonzero probability to get a result between .25 and .75 because its density is nowhere zero, and so any interval will have positive probability, even though the approximated binomial distribution allows only integer results.

The solution is binning: We divide the continuous random variable into bins, that is, intervals. Each integer n gets a bin that goes from n-½ to n+½. And the probability for the continuous distribution to land in the bin is the approximation of the probability for the discrete distribution to land at exactly the integer. Consequently, when calculating probabilities for ranges of results, the ranges should go from and to half integer values. For instance, the probability to get exactly 1 or 2 successes in a binomial distribution corresponds to the normal approximation landing in one of the bins [½,1½] and [1½,2½], which is essentially the bin [½,2½]."

Subtracting Infinities,"The short answer is that subtracting infinities is not defined (edit: in the sense of subtraction in a field)

The longer answer is that Cantor defined cardinalities of sets based on the existence of bijections between sets, and there is a bijection between the set of positive integers and the set of nonnegative  integers. So they have the same cardinality.

Edit: relevant Wikipedia page 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph_number

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number"
Subtracting Infinities,"|A| and |B| are not part of the real numbers or any subset of the real numbers since they are transfinite cardinals. We cannot simply appropriate the algebra used within the real numbers and apply it here without rigor. Recall how >=, <=, and = are defined between set cardinalities,"
Subtracting Infinities,"You are correct regarding both sets being co-cardinal due to the existence of a bijection between them despite one being a proper subset of the other.

You are also correct about cardinal addition. Assuming the axiom of choice, |A|+|B|=max(|A|,|B|). In this case, |A|+|B|=max(|A|,|B|)=|A|=|B|

However, cardinal subtraction is not defined in general. In particular, |X|-|X| can take any value less than or equal to |X|."
Subtracting Infinities,"The problem with defining |X| as the number of elements in X is that infinity is not a real number, and you can't do your usual operations with it. So, things like ∞ + 1 and ∞ - ∞ don't make sense.

Your friend is definitely wrong, though. He's talking about |B - A| not |B| - |A| those things aren't necessarily the same, as seen in this example. Like you said, A and B have the same cardinality, so you could define |S| - |T| to be 0, if there's a bijection between S and T. But with your current definition of |X| and working with real numbes, I don't think there's an answer. Maybe you'd be interested in reading about Aleph numbers to learn a but more about this."
Subtracting Infinities,"> Or in other words, A is a proper/strict subset of B, thus |A| < |B|

Your friend is incorrect: with infinite sets at most you can say A ⊂ B implies |A| ≤ |B|. Your bijection argument is spot on, clearly |A| = |B|.

I'm not aware of a consistent way to define the subtraction of cardinal numbers. Addition doesn't map entirely 1-to-1 with how it works for integers, since |A| + |B| = |A U B|, so it's not clear what an inverse operation ought to be."
Subtracting Infinities,"inf/inf, 0/0, and inf-inf are not defined even on the Rieman Sphere. inf+inf and inf\*inf are defined on the Rieman Sphere."
Subtracting Infinities,"Yes! Just not for **cardinals**, which is what your question is about. Why cardinals don’t behave has already been addressed by other commenters, so let me elaborate on when infinite subtraction **is** defined in the world of ordinals.

For ordinals a>=b, the difference of a and b, denoted a-b, is the unique ordinal c such that a=b+c, thus a=b+(a-b).

That it exists and is unique follows from the following (following Kuratowski/Mostowski 1976). Let A be a set with ot(A)=a and let B be a segment of A of type b and let c=ot(A-B). Clearly, a=b+c. To prove the uniqueness of c suppose that b+c_1=b+c_2. Then, from the monotonicity of ordinal addition (x<y -> z+x<z+y), we must have that ~c_1<c_2 but also ~c_2<c_1, whence by trichotomy of ordinals we have c_1=c_2."

>My question is when I factor out a2 from the original problem, why does it turn into a2-2a-15 and not a2-2-15?

This isn't and I'm not sure where it's coming from; factoring the original equation doesn't factor a single a^2 monomial out and, if it did, we wouldn't get either a^2 - 2a - 15 OR a^2 - 2 - 15, we'd get a^2 - 2 - 15/a^2. 

Think of factoring out a^2 as multiplying the entire polynomial by a^2 / a^2 and then rearranging. That is:

(a^4 - 2a^2 - 15) * a^2 / a^2 = (a^2) * (a^4 - 2a^2 - 15)/(a^2) 

Which can be broken up (which is unnecessary, but nice for clarity) to

(a^2) *(a^4 / a^2 - 2a^2 / a^2 - 15 / a^2)

Which can then be simplified down to

(a^2) * (a^2 - 2 - 15/a^2)

If dy/fx isn’t a fraction then why do we treat it as such?,All situations in which the derivative can be treated like a fraction are backed by rigorous proofs. Many teachers probably believe explaining these proofs would be too much for students just learning derivative rules.
If dy/fx isn’t a fraction then why do we treat it as such?,"The short answer is that dy/dx is not a fraction, but we treat it like one because it makes working with it easier. Think of it as a heuristic; a shortcut to make work easier.

As for separable differential equations, you'll learn it formally if and when you take a differential equations class, but to start with, a differential equation (abbreviated as ODEs) is an equation with derivatives. Just like a normal equation has variables in it and you have to solve for the variable to get a value (Solving x + 3 = 5 gives x = 2), a differential equation has derivatives in it and you have to solve for the function being differentiated to get a family of functions (Solving dy/dx = y gives y = Ce^x, where C is an arbitrary constant). There are several methods to solve ODEs, and separation is one such way, where we throw all the x factors to one side and the y factors to the other and then just integrate both sides.

Finally, what is dx? dx is a differential, and it's essentially a very, very small change in x (or any other variable). That's all you really need to know at this level."
If dy/fx isn’t a fraction then why do we treat it as such?,Read this: [https://online.watsci.org/abstract\_pdf/2019v26/v26n3a-pdf/4.pdf](https://online.watsci.org/abstract_pdf/2019v26/v26n3a-pdf/4.pdf)
If dy/fx isn’t a fraction then why do we treat it as such?,"The derivative is defined as a limit of a fraction. Turns out some of the properties of a fraction are preserved. 

But I think it's confusing to teach it the way you describe it. In Mathematics, rigor is important and this ain't it. You should only be allowed to do these tricks once you have a more in-depth understanding of derivatives, imho."
If dy/fx isn’t a fraction then why do we treat it as such?,It's not a fraction but a lot of people worked to prove that you can use them like fractions in most cases.
If dy/fx isn’t a fraction then why do we treat it as such?,"It's not a fraction, *but* a lot of the proofs in calculus can be really hard to explain without formal proofs, so sometimes it's easier to just lie and treat it like a fraction to explain it. 

For example, with y = x, the derivative is 1 because the slope of y = x is 1 at every value of x (remember: the definition of a derivative is literally just the slope formula).

With separable equations, it's a sneaky use of undoing the chain rule. Remember that chain rule says d/dx\[f(g(x))\] = f'(g(x))g'(x). In a separable equation, you have some function in terms of y times the derivative of y. *Hmmmm* that sure sounds like f'(y)y', which we can *undo* to get f(y). How do you *undo* a derivative? Integrals! That can be a little complicated for students to get though, so it's a lot simpler to just hand wave and be like ""ehhh it's basically a fraction, you've heard the words cross multiply, bam, we get the answer."""
If dy/fx isn’t a fraction then why do we treat it as such?,"You might think of this as a fraction, because of the chain rule:
dy/dx = du/dx * dy/du

It doesn't help that, even in higher math circles, we refer to this as ""cancellation"". 

I personally think of this equation as, vaguely: ""the derivative turns function composition into multiplication"". We just use clever notation to get this across.

Fractions are a ratio between two values. There are no such two values here. The chain rule has one function on the left, and a product of two functions on the right.

We can also look directly at dy/dx. This is a function, not a fraction. For example, you don't have: 
- (dy/dx)² = dy²/dx², the right being jibberish
- 1/dx is not a thing
- dx is not really a thing, found only in algorithms centered specifically around such notation"
If dy/fx isn’t a fraction then why do we treat it as such?,"If you go from differentials to infinitely small steps ∆y/∆x, they will be real fractions (more like division). You even can find that it is equal to tan(alpha).

On the other side d is ""operator"" (not really, you cant calc dx own value).  You can think about dx as of density of points along x-axis. It is meaningless by itself, but you can compare one d with another."
If dy/fx isn’t a fraction then why do we treat it as such?,"**TL;DR:** The derivative isn't a fraction, it's a functor that maps functions to fractions, which is why in many cases you can't tell the difference. I'll explain what it means below.

>Another thing we learn in class is something like: dy/dx = f(x)/g(x)

I assume you meant dy/dx = f(x)/g(y), so that you can rewrite it as g(y)dy = f(x)dx, so that G(y) - F(x) = C, where F is the antiderivative of f, and G is the antiderivative of g.

The proof is simple: let U be an open subset of ℝ, and let f, g, h, F, G: U → ℝ be smooth (i.e. infinitely differentiable) functions satisfying the equations:
1. U = {x ∈ ℝ | g(x) ≠ 0} - an open subset of ℝ, i.e. a union of (possibly an infinite number of) open intervals.
2. F'(x) = f(x),
3. G'(x) = g(x),
4. h'(x) = f(x) / g(h(x)).

Consider the function D(x) = G(h(x)) - F(x). Differentiating it, we get G'(h(x)) h'(x) - F'(x) = g(h(x)) h'(x) - f(x) = 0 because of (4). Therefore, D(x) = const, which is just the integral form of the equation f(x)dx = g(y)dy. This proves that what you're doing with the separation of variables is valid.

Since the proof basically boils down to the application of the chain rule, we can go out on a limb and say that ""dy/dx behaves like a fraction because of the chain rule."" This is true in the sense that differentials in general behave like linear approximations of functions, and linear maps in dimension 1 are represented by 1x1 matrices, i.e. just numbers. Composite functions then are mapped into the products of these numbers (because composing f(x) = ax with g(x) = bx yields (g ◦ f)(x) = g(f(x)) = (ab)x), leading to lots of ""multiplicative tricks"" just working as long as you're only interested in local behaviour near a point - because many propositions about functions and their derivatives can be rephrased in terms of equations involving just function composition and the derivative operator, and in this context you lose almost no data as long as you're only interested in what happens near one point at a time.

Another example of a trick that works because of the chain rule is that dx/dy = 1/(dy/dx): if U is some small open neighbourhood of x, and f: U → V is a smooth function that that has a smooth inverse, i.e. a smooth function f^(-1): V → U such that f^(-1) ◦ f = id_U and f ◦ f^(-1) = id_V, then it's easy to prove that (f^(-1))'(f(x)) = 1/f'(x) by differentiating these equalities. As a simple corollary, a smooth function with a smooth inverse cannot have zero derivative. The *inverse function theorem* provides a partial converse to this proposition.

When dealing with several variables, this similarity is maintained in the sense that the differential of a composition of functions is the composition of these functions' differentials, i.e. [D(g ◦ f) = Dg ◦ Df](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushforward_(differential)), the latter corresponding to the multiplication of the corresponding Jacobi matrices. Thus, more advanced versions of these ""multiplicative tricks"" continue to work, although you have to replace multiplication of numbers with multiplication of matrices, so fractions stop being a good notation/metaphor.

I hope this helps. What I'd like you to take away from this explanation is that ""Construction X behaves roughly like Y in the right context"" often just means that the way that X acts on functions preserves function composition in some sense, and this function composition post application happens to encode the meaning of Y in this context. This property is called [functoriality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functor), and once you know about it, you'll start seeing it basically everywhere in modern mathematics, it's one of the most useful mathematical ideas of the 20th century."

If dy/fx isn’t a fraction then why do we treat it as such?,"It is a fraction in some cases.

First of all, think about what it means to take the derivative of a function at some specific point.

The (change in y) over the (change in x)  
∆y/∆x  
This is the slope of the function, and yes, it is a fraction. I am using delta because that's how it was originally defined. d and D both refer to slightly different things in a minute. The specific form ∆y/∆x refers to the solution of the function as the delta approaches zero. I hope you have already covered alternative approximations of slope, and this is just the final answer you would get for the exact slope without any error.

So, ∆y/∆x represents the slope of the function for any arbitrary location. You can then normalize this value to refer to the functional representation of the derivative of the function as well. This is where you get something like this:  

f'(x) = ∆y/∆x as a functional notation = dy/dy

So, dy/dx represents both steps being performed at once. Okay, it actually gets a bit more complex once you reach defininte vs indefinite derivatives, but that's a whole other can of worms.

Back to ∆y/∆x

The slope is a fraction, and you can write ANY function as a fraction equalling something else. For example y=2x can be rewritten as y/x=2.

The reason why dy/dx is often (badly) desribed as ""not a fraction"" is because you need to simplify it back once you are done. That being said, you can have cases where you have multiple dy/dy in a function, and you can absolutely use anything that you would use with fractions to simplify it in order to solve for dy/dx.

Oh, this is a bit of a side note, but it's similar to how you can technically use f(x) as a variable, so 2*f(x)=3 can be simplified to f(x)=3/2. True, f(x) really doesn't mean much by itself, but it does represent something that can be acted upon by other math rules. This does come up in some cases of set notation to solve for infinite series."
If dy/fx isn’t a fraction then why do we treat it as such?,"[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/calculus/s/NkIr5xTmHC) is one of my previous posts addressing the exact same issue, that students find it difficult to understand the concept of differentiation intuitively if we taught it the the conversational way how it has always been taught.

How do I understand 3D vectors better,Create the textbook problems/exam questions using Geogebra. This really helps
How do I understand 3D vectors better,You can try using desmos 3d to visualize them
How do I understand 3D vectors better,"I've taught quite a few undergraduate and graduate engineering students that needed a very strong understanding of vectors. One of the easiest recommendations I had for all of them was to read at least the first chapter of ""A brief on tensor analysis"" by Simmonds. It's published by Springer, so if you're at a university then there's a decent chance you already have free access to it. It looks like it's also available on the internet archive. Also, it is very brief. The whole book is roughly 100 pages. The part I'm recommending is only about 15 pages.

A lot of people teach vectors in a purely algebraic way. They introduce equations as definitions handed down from on high, and then just tell you to shut up and calculate with them. This is an atrocious way to teach. 

For others, all of the teaching involves making computations using the components of a vector, and this leaves students feeling completely justified in thinking that vectors are really just lists of numbers. This is also an atrocious way to teach. 

So what does Simmonds do that's different? He certainly provides you with all the standard definitions and formulas you might be looking for, but he goes further to highlight the **geometric** significance of these equations. He shows you why these equations make sense (routinely without making calculations involving components). One of the main reasons physicists / engineers use vectors (and tensors) all over the place is **because** of their geometric properties. Using them is one way of ensuring that different people can use different descriptions of an event (e.g., by using different coordinate systems or reference frames) and yet they still agree on what happened.

In case you're also in need of a resource for learning how to use different coordinate systems (e.g., describing vectors in polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates) then this book is also a great resource for that information as well.

Big math question,"You are falling into one of the most common traps people fall into early in their mathematica journey, physicallization. You are think of mathematical operations as if they were physical things that you did to objects, instead of things you to do *numbers* (or other mathematical entities) that you can use to *describe* physical objects. Multiplication is not a physical process. 

You can't multiply pencils. Or add pencils. Or divide pencils. Any more than you can spell a fish or conjugate a raccoon. We spell and conjugate *words* and use words to *describe* the world. We do arithmetic with *numbers* and then use numbers to *describe* the world.

If I have one pencil in a box, and another two pencils in a different box, I can use the expression 1 + 2 = 3 to describe how many pencils I have now. But I am not adding pencils, I am adding numbers.

If I have three box of two pencils, I can use the expression 3 x 2 = 2 to describe how many total pencils I have. But I didn't multiply pencils or boxes. I multiplied numbers 

'What is a pencil multiplied by itself' makes as much sense as 'what color is justice' or 'how much does hungry weigh'. It's what we would call a 'category error'.

Then from either point find the x value of the x intercept with x0 = x1 - (y1 - 1/m). The x-intercept will then be (x0, 0).

---

Explanation:

Slope = rise/run, if we imagine our x-intercept as (x0, y0), then we know the slope between either point and that x intercept will be:

m = (y1 - y0)/(x1 - x0)

However, the x-intercept is defined as the point where y = 1 here, so we really have the point (x0, 1) and, subbing that in, we get

m = (y1 - 1)/(x1 - x0)

we've already solved for m and are given x1 and y1, so we just have to rearrange

Multiply both sides by (x1 - x0)

(x1-x0)m = y1 - 1

Divide both sides by m

x1 - x0 = (y1 - 1)/m

Subtract x1 from both sides

-x0 = (y1 - 1)/m - x1

Multiply both sides by -1

x0 = x1 - (y1 - 1)/m

The intuitive explanation for this is ""we know how quickly the line is going up, and we know how high it is at point 1. From that we should be able to tell how long it took it to get there from the axis.""

---

With example numbers:

Let points be (2, 7) and (5, 16)

Then m = (16-7)/(5-2) = 9/3 = 3

find x0 with either initial point:

x0 = 2 - (7-1)/3 = 0

OR

x0 = 5 - (16-1)/3 = 0

So the x-intercept is (0, 1)"

###Determine ""m; b""
Let's find the unknown parameters for the line equation first. Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate ""b"" and obtain

    y1  =  Y(x1)  =  m*x1 + b    =>    y2-y1  =  m*(x2-x1)      |:(x2-x1)
    y2  =  Y(x2)  =  m*x2 + b              m  =  (y2-y1) / (x2-x1)

Solve the first equation for ""b = y1 - m\*x1"" and get

    Y(x)  =  m*x + b  =  m*(x-x1) + y1    // m = (y2-y1) / (x2-x1)
***
###Find x-intercept
Since the x-axis goes through ""y = 1"", we need to find ""x"" s.th. ""Y(x) = 1"":

          1  =  Y(x)  =  m*(x-x1) + y1    

    =>    x  =  (1-y1)/m + x1  =  (1-y1) * (x1-x1)/(y2-y1)  +  x1"

What is **multiplication?** For example, what does ""8 × 3"" mean? If you answered >!repeated addition!< then you're running into the same issue. Sure, 8 × 3 means 8 + 8 + 8, but -5 × 2.7 is NOT writing multiple copies of a number and adding those together.

> Why did mathematicians choose to define sin() angles beyond 0 to 90°? Is sin() with angles > 90° just abstract notion/definition for convenience or is there concrete geometry?

Extremely concrete. sin(t) is the y-coordinate of a point on the unit circle---[picture](https://www.mathmistakes.info/facts/TrigFacts/learn/images/ucdefp.gif)---and this works perfectly fine for angles outside of 0° to 90°."
Intuition for angles > 90° for sin(),"Do you know the unit circle? Sin is the y value of the corridnate of the unit circle.

Using this we can see how the sin works for angels past 90.

Between 90 and 180 it's sin(180-angle) because the sin(89)=sin(91) based on the until circle 

Between 180 and 270 it's -sin(angle-180) 

Between 270 and 360 it's -sin(360-angle)

Help,"Let ""p; q"" be the two primes, and let ""n = 13800"" for simplicity:

    n  =  13800  =  p^2 - q^2  =  (p-q)*(p+q)

Since ""p+q > 0"", ""p-q"" must be as well. Note ""q > 0"", so ""p+q"" > p-q"" "". Factorize  ""n = 2^3 * 3 * 5^2 * 23"", and note it has ""4\*2\*3\*2 = 48"" positive factor pairs ""(f1; f2)"". Since ""n"" is not a perfect square, ""f1 != f2"".

Setting ""(p-q; p+q) = (f1; f2)"", we only need to check the 24 factor pairs ""0 < f1 < f2"":

Now consider the actual factors of 13800.

So we need to be able to allocate those prime powers to the factors (p-q) and (p+q). But also note that if (p-q) and (p+q) share a factor then their sum and difference will also be divisible by that factor, meaning that 2p and 2q would both be divisible by it, too. If that factor is anything other than 2, this would imply at least one of p and q are not prime, which would be a contradiction to our original statement. So, ignoring 2 for a moment, we need to make sure that (p+q) and (p-q) share no odd factors.

Quick Math Question,[deleted]
Quick Math Question,">I understand graphically why x cannot be 0, but when presented with 66/x=66/x, why is it incorrect to multiply both sides by x\^2 to get 66x=66x?

There's actually an *extremely* important point you need to understand here.

If you have a true equation, and you do something to both sides of the equation, you get another true equation.  That **does not** mean that every solution to the second equation is a solution to the first equation.  It **only** means that every solution to the first equation is also a solution to the second equation.

Now, if you do **certainly types of things** to both sides of an equation, it can moreover be true that every solution to the second equation is a solution to the first.  But don't conflate this with the general case, which is just that you can do something to both sides of a true equation and it remains true."
Quick Math Question,"For a solution to be valid, it needs to make the *original* equation true. If you plug 0 into the original equation, you get 66/0 = 66/0, which is not true because undefined expressions can't be compared. This is because you *introduced* a fake solution when you multiplied both sides by x.

In general, you should always be careful when multiplying an equation on both sides by any expression containing a variable. Take the simple equation x=1, which clearly only has one solution. If you multiply both sides by x, it turns into x^2 = x, which has *two* solutions: x=0, and x=1. Clearly, x=0 does not satisfy the original x=1, so we discover that we've *added* an ""extraneous"" solution that does not satisfy the original equation.

Similarly, if you *divide* by an expression that contains a variable, you risk *missing out on* a solution that does satisfy the original equation. The solution that is added/lost when you multiply/divide by a variable expression generally corresponds to [expression]=0. 

So if you multiply by x+3, you might create a fake solution of x=-3. 

If you divide at any point by x-2, you might lose the solution x=2.

You always have to go back and check with the original."
Quick Math Question,66/x way also has infinitely many solutions. But there's a single number you can't plug into that version.
Quick Math Question,You need to define the domain *before* simplifications.
Quick Math Question,"You're asking why a constant multiplied by a variable is not the same thing as a constant divided by a variable?


The solution sets of both of the equations you are asking about are infinite, it's just that 0 is not in the solution set for 66/x = 66/x, as you already know. 


I'm not really sure what your confusion here is."
Quick Math Question,"Going from 66x = 66x to 66/x = 66/x involves dividing by x^2 , an operation defined for all x != 0. So, going from one to the other the equality holds but the domain of the solution set changes to exclude 0. This isn't automatically rectified when going in reverse, so a special case would have to verify that 66x = 66x for x = 0 in order to claim it (rightfully) as part of the new solution set"

"What is the horizontal line (for ""equals"") in column arithmetic called?",I don’t believe it has a formal name
"What is the horizontal line (for ""equals"") in column arithmetic called?","The term ""result line"" is often seen in common conversation.

If you want something more formal, the term [""underline"" or even ""underscore""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore) is correct and probably most accurate in regards to typesetting. For example, the typical [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) implementation would be using the `\underline` command on a box containing the expression. The `\rule` command is sometimes used instead depending on how the column arithmetic is written just because it's easier, so you *could* also call it a ""horizontal rule"" if you want to annoy a bunch of typographers.

In terms of math-specific vocab, the most accurate term would be [""vinculum""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinculum_(symbol)) (plural: ""vincula""), but that typically applies to the line in grouping operators (radicals, fraction bars, etc), repeating decimal notation, and other forms of grouping of *elements of an expression*. The argument of course would be that you're simply grouping *all* of the elements of the first expression to separate them from the second expression and avoid using an equals sign. The original (early Renaissance) users of vincula would likely agree with this terminology, but in the modern day the word has become more specialized since we replaced most uses of vincula with other grouping symbols like parentheses."

How to read Mathematics?,"small tip based off what i noticed in your comment, writing in LaTex can often help (eg ‘belongs to’ and ‘is a member of’ both basically just mean ‘is in’). a similar effect can be noticed with other symbols. beyond that, try taking a proof for example and see if you can convert entirely into words (and numbers) by “translating” all the notation"
How to read Mathematics?,"Fundamentally, maths is about precision. There are often many equivalent ways of saying the same thing, but you must be precise and ensure your meaning is the same. It can also often depend on context, where the same symbols are used to mean different things. For example, in set theory ""x belongs to S"" and ""x is an element of S"" may be equivalent ways to expressing ""x \in S"", but ""x is a value of S"", to my ears, is subtly different. This is a phrasing that would be more typically associated with functions, and it's unclear what exactly is meant by ""value"" here—could it something associated with the set as a whole, for example? It's not the best example and it would be mostly understood, but using terms like ""element"" and relationships like ""belongs to"" are specific and accurate terms that will be well understood, making communication easier. I'm not sure if that answers your question, but basically you can express the concept behind the notation any way you like, but learning the usual wording used for notation (perhaps using a cheatsheet) and the appropriate terminology will help you be specific and well-understood."
How to read Mathematics?,"I just kinda picked up habits off the people who were teaching me. My favorite is sort of a hot take, and it is calling f(g(x)), ""f after g"", instead of ""f of g"", or ""f composed with g"". The main thing is that you can understand and reproduce the notation, assuming you can do that, and understand what you are doing, then just talk about what you are doing in a way that is natural, descriptive, and precise, and it should all come together; I don't believe there is standard linguistics surrounding math, think about how many languages would have to agree for that to happen!"
How to read Mathematics?,"Usually introductory textbooks on that topic explain what the symbols mean and how to ""say"" them. Also, usually, Latex notation tells you how to read it. x \\in S can be read as x in S, where x is some element and S is a set.

How to read Mathematics?,"I don't understand how you can understand formula but don't know how to 'read' it?

So, using function notation as an example, namely f(x), to read it would be to say ""f of x."" To understand it would be to know that it's an equation that produces a unique y value for each x. Another way to think about functions is in terms of cause and effect: the x values are independent variables (the cause), the y values (the effect) are dependent on x, and each individual cause produces one effect. To explain it with analogy: each product at the grocery store has a unique bar code (the x value), and scanning it produces a single price (the y value); if a product is scanned and two different prices pop up, it's not a function. Thinking of it spatially you could do a vertical line test on a graph: if a vertical line crosses 2 points on the graph, it's not a function (which could only happen if the same x value yields 2 different y values).

There are many, many ways to understand something in math. You could understand it in technical terms, by analogy, or by visualizing what's going on, and you can explain something to someone using one or all of these methods. Some students are visual thinkers, others prefer verbal explanations while others like analogy, and a good teacher would incorporate all these methods into a lesson. But when it comes to reading it, there's usually only one way to do that: f(x) is read ""f of x."" That's it."

It's hard to help without knowing what specifically is giving you trouble, but one piece of advice is to just take your time and go through the steps, and be deliberate about why you are doing something. I'd also ask you to try and understand the why as much as possible.

How can I get better at algebra?,"You absolutely should focus on a specific operation. It's not a huge complicated web of interlocking pieces that are somehow larger than the sum of their parts. Algebra is built off a list of 11 rules, and you have to be able to read a bit of notation. 

People mostly struggle because they never got the foundations. Once you master the basics, the rest is pretty much automatic, because you're just following rules. But you can't follow the rules if you don't read them. Common issues are not knowing what a function really is (it's not complicated), thinking parentheses cause multiplication (they don't do anything), and reading subtraction wrong (subtraction isn't real). 

Whatever your issues are, you can only fix one at a time. They don't work together and they don't have to be untangled. And the list is shorter than you think. 

Basically this is to agree with the others: pick one thing that is an issue and post a question about it. Make sure it's totally solid to the foundations. Then repeat. It won't actually take that long. Most people try to learn math by aping different problem types. You can't learn math that way (literally, it's impossible). But the list of rules is pretty short.

That said, here's an algorithm I came up with.  I haven't thoroughly tested this but it seems to work.  But it's extremely tedious and impractical to try to execute the algorithm by hand, so here's a JavaScript version I made: [https://pacobell15.neocities.org/math/fraction](https://pacobell15.neocities.org/math/fraction)

Try it out.  In your example, it turns out that 15/1 is a good enough approximation if we only care about a percent error of 1% or less.  (15/1 = 15, whereas the actual value is around 14.91896024464832, so this gives us a percent error of around 0.5%, well within the 1% range.)

    Let VALUE = NUMERATOR/DENOMINATOR (e.g. 9757 ÷ 654 = 14.91896024464832)
    Let PERCENT_ERROR = the desired percent error
    Let TOO_HIGH = the biggest possible value with the right amount of error --
                   calculate this as ((100%+PERCENT_ERROR)*NUMERATOR)/DENOMINATOR
    Let TOO_LOW = the smallest possible value with the right amount of error --
                   calculate this as ((100%-PERCENT_ERROR)*NUMERATOR)/DENOMINATOR
    
    We shall start off trying a denominator of 1 (and we will gradually increase
     this number until we find the lowest denominator that works)
    
    We loop until we break out of the loop{
    
        Set the numerator to floor(VALUE*denominator) where VALUE is the value we
        precalculated (at the very top).
    
        Since we rounded the numerator down, it might be too low.  So we want to
        keep adding 1 to the numerator until the new value is at least as big as
        the TOO_LOW value.
    
        Since we've been adding 1 to the numeratior, it's possible that we overshot.
        So if our value is greater than the TOO_HIGH value, we need to increase the
        denominator by 1 and repeat the process all over again, starting at the
        beginning of the loop but this time with a bigger denominator.
    
        But if we didn't overshoot, then we've found the answer.  So we break.
    
    }

JavaScript version:

    const NUMERATOR = 9757;
    const DENOMINATOR = 654;
    const PERCENT_ERROR = 0.0001;
    const VALUE = NUMERATOR/DENOMINATOR;
    const TOO_HIGH = ((1.0+PERCENT_ERROR)*NUMERATOR)/DENOMINATOR;
    const TOO_LOW = ((1.0-PERCENT_ERROR)*NUMERATOR)/DENOMINATOR;
    
    var denominator = 1;
    var numerator;
    while(true){
        numerator = Math.floor(VALUE*denominator)
        while((numerator/denominator)<TOO_LOW){
            numerator += 1
        }
        if((numerator/denominator)>TOO_HIGH){
            denominator += 1;
        }
        else{
            break;
        }
    }
    
    // numerator and denominator should now be set to the correct numbers"
Is there a method to round a fraction to another fraction?,Would be helpful to know what kind of precision you need.
Is there a method to round a fraction to another fraction?,"Sure. Calculate the fraction in decimal, truncate at whatever digit you like and make it fraction again by multiplying to the top and bottom by a factor of 10^n to get it into fraction form. 

So 9757/654 = 14.91896 let's say we care about 3 digits of accuracy so 14.9 then to get it back into a fraction 149/10 is about equal to 9757/654"
Is there a method to round a fraction to another fraction?,"Just represent the fraction as a float. The error will be the epsilon machine.

This is exactly what floating point are. They aren't real numbers, but the best approximation in the address space you have."
Is there a method to round a fraction to another fraction?,"did anyone suggest a mixed number?  
your fraction above is approximately 15 but that aside, its 14 + 601/654 (14\* 654 subtracted from 9757 is 601).  The modulo (usually %) operator in programming languages can help you get this.  then reduce it either exactly or approximately.  Approximately, its 600/654 is 300/327 is 100/109...  109 is prime so either stuck here or approximate farther.  14+100/109 is 14.91743 vs 14.91896.

However I am in the camp that you either need it exact or just use floating point in a computer program.  If you need it exact, you float the point yourself, eg a 64 bit integer and off the side, a power of 10 for where the decimal goes. (you can use other powers than 10, but being human, its the easy one)."
Why is the limit as x tends to infinity of x-(x^2)ln(1+1/x) = 1/2 and not 0?,"Let ""f(x) = 1 - x\*ln(1 + 1/x)"". Then we want to find

Why is the limit as x tends to infinity of x-(x^2)ln(1+1/x) = 1/2 and not 0?,"Because, as it stands, you have an indeterminate form. x^2 tends to infinity, but ln(1+ 1/x ) tends to zero. And infinity times zero is bad.

We have to use The Hospital Rule™️ here. I’m not going to write out the steps, but your logic seems correct until the end. x•ln(1 + 1/x ) is 1, but multiplying by x gives infinity here."
Why is the limit as x tends to infinity of x-(x^2)ln(1+1/x) = 1/2 and not 0?,"That's because x -> ∞ and x²ln(1+1/x) -> ∞, and so your limit is of the form ∞ - ∞, or if you factor out an x, it's ∞ × 0. Just because f(x) - g(x) -> 0, that doesn't mean that x(f(x) - g(x)) -> 0, in fact you can find examples where it goes to any real number, +∞, -∞, or diverges."

"How should one prove that (ℤ, ⋅) is a commutative monoid?","1. prove it's a monoid
2. prove it's commutative

More seriously: what's your definition of ℤ and multiplication? If you don't have formal definitions the whole thing is pointless from the get go"
"How should one prove that (ℤ, ⋅) is a commutative monoid?","For really obvious examples like this it kind of depends on what basic facts you already have access to in your class. If you don't 
'know' that integer multiplication is commutative then you need to [build it from the formal definition](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Integer_Multiplication_is_Commutative) of integers. But usually this is just checking off the boxes: if you have enough facts at the ready then you're done after re-stating that multiplication is closed, commutative, associative, and has a unique identity."
"How should one prove that (ℤ, ⋅) is a commutative monoid?","Is it though? Don't you need the inverse?
Nvm, I seen the notation and thought of a group.

Apparently to show it's a monoid, you just need to show it has an identity, and associativity. A commutative monoid adds commutativity in there.

Thus, there exists some a contained within the set of integers that x *a = x.
For all a*x = x*a
And for all x,y,z within the integers you have (x*y)*z = x*(y*z)

Thus all are shown. This is basically it, it's a declaration. Another way to prove it is with induction."

4th grade math—typo or error?,"The expected response is 4.62, for sure. 

But I agree with you that “average distance per week” means to average the weekly mileages. Since he runs 13.85 miles in each week, the weekly average is 13.85. I’m (also) a runner and this is how we would interpret the question. 

Try to have a friendly conversation with the teacher about it. No need to put them on the defensive. 

Also as a runner, nobody runs 6.75 or 4.6 miles! We are obsessive about round numbers even if means running in a little circle to get up to the next mile."
4th grade math—typo or error?,"Yeah, average distance he runs per week would just be the sum of those three numbers.  But teach has taken their arithmetic mean (sum/3). That means that what teach wants is really the answer to the question, “on average, how far does he run *when he goes running*, or, *per running session*?” Note that I don’t say per day because for that you’d have to include all the 0-mile values from his off days.

Edit: for clarity"
4th grade math—typo or error?,"You can calculate the Distance by using the three days provided. Which is 4,something km on average.

Because add them up and divide by 3. But it's absolutely worded wrong.  It's not the average of the week buy on average on the distance ran on any particular day that week.  Otherwise it would be divided by 7, or 52 for weeks in a year... it's dumb"

The problem here is the teacher's expectations are not being communicated properly in the words they chose.

If she believes that the logic in her statement is correct, extend the data points to a month (4 weeks), where distances are provided for various days across various weeks, and then ask her how she would calculate the average distance per week.

Would she group the days by week, sum them up, divide by number of days actually ran for each week, then add up the results for each week and divide by 4?"
4th grade math—typo or error?,"Your daughter's teacher probably has zero math background, unfortunately.

The question is no where close to what the teacher thinks it is.

""Distance he runs each week"" is just the sum of the values.  (There is no ""average"" since there isn't any variability.)

Even the ""average distance run per day in a week"" isn't going to give one of those choices, because that would be (2.5+4.6+6.75)/7

Obviously  there's a simple formula involving the number of xdays in a week if it is not zero or one  I have already played my ace which is it's a simple sum to find the total run in a particular week.

About learning math… figure out what your learning style is and then find resources that work for you. Do you feel comfortable with textbooks and reading?

I need help understanding Godel's incompleteness theorem,"The encoding isn't actually important, just the fact that numbers can be encoded. The key piece is negating a self-referential statement. The application in Godel's theorem is pretty convoluted due to all the encoding though. If you're interested, here's a more straightforward example of the concept: the functional fixed point theorem.

A fixed point of a function is a value that maps to itself, f(x)=x. Some functions have fixed points, like x=1 and x=0 for f(x)=x\^2, and some functions like f(x)=x+1 have no fixed points.

A recursive functional is a function that takes recursive functions and other recursive functionals as inputs (so we're talking about functions of functions). The functional fixed point theorem is that *every* recursive functional has a fixed point.

To see this, let F be a recursive functional. Then A(x)=F(x(x)) is a recursive functional. Specifically: A takes an input function, x, and applies x to itself, x(x), then applies F to that. Now note that A(A)=F(A(A)), so F maps A(A) to A(A). That is, A(A) is necessarily a fixed point of F.

Godel essentially does the same thing with statements. Recursive functionals can be encoded as statements (Kleene Strong Representability theorem) and statements can be encoded as numbers. So Godel constructs the following statement ¬∃v(Proof(Y,v)) (where Y is a free variable) then shows that this statement has a fixed point, G, so G⇔¬∃v(Proof(G,v)).



If you're interested in a full explanation of the proof let me know and we can walk through it, but it's a bit of endeavor."
I need help understanding Godel's incompleteness theorem,"The book ""Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid"" by Douglas Hofstadter, is as thorough a layman's exploration of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem as I've ever seen, anywhere. 

It alternates between playful fiction chapters to illustrate the ideas in a very intuitive manner, with much more formal non-fiction chapters, explaining Formal Logic systems, and Strange Loops, which very closely relates to Godel's Theorem. Also references Russell And Whitehead's ""Principia Mathematica"".

The book has many different english ""translations"" of the Incompleteness Theorem, as a way of giving you a solid intuitive idea of the meaning of the Theorem, how it works, why it works the way it does.

It's an excellent and entertaining read, and covers a lot of other stuff as well; zen koans, Bach's music, Escher's drawings, Zeno's Paradox, artificial intelligence, Aesop's fables, genies and meta-genies, and fictional sentient minds made up of an ant colony. Holism vs. Reductionism, and how all this stuff is actually related. 

And most of all, Strange Loops, of which your self-referential statement is an example, and plays an important part in Godel's Theorem, perhaps even the central key part.

Wikipedia entry on [""Strange Loops""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_loop)

Escher's famous unending looping staircase drawing, an optical illusion, is a visual example of a Strange Loop."

I need help understanding Godel's incompleteness theorem,"As you say, a single number can represent a sequence of symbols; you just need a consistent conversion scheme, of which there are many. In the case of the Godel sentence, the sequence of symbols describes (among other things) the construction of a particular number. Imagine if I encoded ""256^(2)"" as a string of symbols, then used a conversion system to turn that into a number, and the number was 65536.

Godel's conversion system rapidly produces huge numbers. There are more familiar ways to convert strings of symbols to numbers, like ASCII or UTF used in modern computing to store or transmit the text you're reading now."

Want to do academic comeback in calculus.,"Did you get back your exam papers? Study them all. Analyze them for the mistakes you made and what caused the marks to be dropped (ran out of time?, didn't understand the problem?, made simple algebra errors?, etc etc) This kind of post mortem is useful to know yourself better. 

If you ran out of time, then improve your time management and test taking strategy. Scan your exam. Do the easy problems first (fairly quickly), then learn how to assess the remaining problems. Leave the ones you don't understand until last. 

If you're making simple errors, either practice more or also do your work more carefully. Instead of skipping steps, write each step line by line. It may take longer at first but with practice, it reduces the silly errors and you'll get faster.

Effective learning is not only quantity but quality. Learning how to manage time, eliminate errors, breaking down problems, assessing whether it is easy or hard. Don't blindly do exercise problems, keep track of your speed, also don't just look at the solutions without trying, understand each step the textbook explains rather than blindly following the method. All these are things that increase learning and test taking  effectiveness."

[Real Analysis] Prove that the inf(A) = 0,"Let's try proving it directly without any contradictions first --- a direct approach is usually easier and more informative. Firstly, A can be bounded below by zero easily: >!the numerator is positive, and the denominator is positive, so the fraction is positive!<

We see that when x and y are near zero, the fraction becomes very large. And as x and y become very large, the fraction goes to zero. This gives us a hint of how to choose x and y. We should choose something that looks like: >!x = 1/e and y = 1/e, so that very small e means that x and y are very big, and so the fraction goes to zero and hopefully becomes smaller than e.!<

Let's try it. >!The fraction xy/x2+y2 becomes 1/2, but this is not smaller than arbitrary e, say, e can be 0.1. Maybe we can modify it to x = 1/e2 and y = 1/e, and this yields e/(1+e2) < e which is true, and so we have successfully found the element that exists.

A simple approach is just to fix y, say y = 1.  A quick sketch of x / (x^2 + 1) shows that it is 0 when x = 0, and goes through a maximum of 1/2 when x = 1.  So for any 0 <= a < 1/2, there is an x > 0 with x / (x^2 + 1 ) = a, so a is in A.  (If you want to really demonstrate this, you could solve the equation x / (x^2 + 1) = a and you'll see it has a positive solution for a < 1/2).

How can I understand the logic of arithmetic better (seriously)?,"I'm not quite sure what you're asking, but you might be interested in the cardinal/ordinal distinction.

We primarily use numbers for two things: assigning to a collection of things an amount (cardinal value) and an order (ordinal value). Usually these two concepts are so closely related that we do not distinguish between the two. If you have five things, then you can order them 1-2-3-4-5, and if you have ordered a collection 1-2-3-4-5, then it must be that you have 5 things.

However as you've noticed, this is a useful correspondence, but they are not identical properties. Proving that cardinal and ordinal values correspond for finite numbers is one of the first things you prove in a formal set theory class, and what's particularly interesting is that they DO NOT correspond for transfinite numbers.

You might also be interested in looking up the formal definition by recursion of the natural numbers. You can find these in formal systems like Peano Arithmetic."

You don't get the jump from the first interpretation to the second.

It's pretty interesting and well done, though I wouldn't call it definitive.


One of the things it talks about that I found interesting is ""subitizing,"" a phenomenon in which humans can instantly count small numbers of objects. So, if we're looking at three things, we don't need to count them to know there are three. By five objects it becomes conditional--if they're in, or close to fitting, certain configurations, we can know there are five without counting, but in order arrangements we'll either need to count, or to subitize two subgroups and add.


I know it's not exactly the same thing you're asking, but I think you'll find it relevant. They don't stop at arithmetic, either; the book goes into advanced topics like calculus as well to some extent. "

The power rule, chain rule, product rule and quotient rule are derived from the basic definition. The proofs should all be included in any calculus textbook. 

Hence the derivative of ln(x) being 1/x is an application of the above rules that come from the original definition of a derivative.

In the case of the derivative of ln(x), intuition would be understanding that the slope is infinitely large at zero, and that it goes to 0 as x goes to infinity. True understanding would be understanding how you can prove that the derivative of ln(x) is 1/x and why it makes sense."

"My proof is long, and I feel it is incomplete nonetheless",""" Suppose that for any k ∈ ℕ∩{0} such that 0 ≤ k ≤ d, where d ∈ ℕ, for any formula φ, if δ(φ) = k, then φ is balanced.""

What is delta? Presumably you meant to use union instead of intersection. But since you add the 0 <= k <= d condition, you couldve just said k in {0, 1, ... d}.

I am not a logic person, but the proof essentially boils down to:

Any formula is either a ""scentence symbol"" as you say, or a concatenation of smaller formulas with extra symbols, where the extra symbols have an even number of parenthesis (easy to see by manual case work)

By strong induction, it follows that every formula has an even number of parenthesis (sum of even numbers is even)."
"My proof is long, and I feel it is incomplete nonetheless","I think you have the right idea, and using strong induction is correct, you could just simplify the presentation. Here’s an example.

Let *p*(*f*) = (*l*, *r*) count the number of left and right parentheses in formula *f*. Call it balanced when *l* = *r*. Let *h*(*f*) be the height of *f*.

*f* may be atomic or compound.

If *f* is atomic, *h*(*f*) = 0, and *p*(*f*) = (0, 0), which is balanced.

If *f* is compound, it’s a parenthetical connective with a sequence of 1 ≤ *n* ≤ 2 subformulas *f*[1] … *f*[*n*]. Then *h*(*f*) = 1 + max {*h*(*f*[*i*]) | 1 ≤ *i* ≤ *n*}, so the height of subformulas is strictly decreasing: for all *i*, *h*(*f*[*i*]) < *h*(*f*). And *p*(*f*) = (1, 1) + Σ[1 ≤ *i* ≤ *n*] *p*(*f*[*i*]), where (*a*, *b*) + (*c*, *d*) = (*a* + *c*, *b* + *d*). Since the sums of equal sequences are equal, if *f*[*i*] is balanced for all *i*, then *f* is balanced. By strong induction on *h*, *f* is balanced."
"My proof is long, and I feel it is incomplete nonetheless","This would be vastly simpler if you just counted the difference between the number of open and close parens, rather than counting them separately.

More generally, it can be shown that structural induction is equivalent to strong induction over structure depth (number of production rules applied to reach a given structure), and this example becomes very simple when expressed in those terms."
"My proof is long, and I feel it is incomplete nonetheless","Another approach is via minimal counterexample.  Suppose λ is a counterexample with the smallest possible number of left parentheses; let this number be p.  If p = 0, then ….   If p > 0, then ….   

No subexpression of λ will be a counterexample, so the parentheses will be balanced in all subexpressions of λ.  Play with this."
"My proof is long, and I feel it is incomplete nonetheless","Your proof went way over my head so I won't comment on whether or not it works (I've never taken a mathematical proof-writing course and am not familiar with some of that notation).  But I don't think this actually requires induction.

If you're trying to prove that all formulas are balanced then I think you can use a proof by contradiction.

My idea is something like this:  We begin with the fact that every ""formula"" is either simple (i.e. a sentence) or compound (i.e. meets one of your conditions #2-6, although I think you've overlooked a somewhat trivial seventh condition: `γ is (θ), where θ is a formula`).  If it is compound, then it has a very particular syntax but the important thing is that it has formulas nested within itself, and these formulas can themselves be either simple or compound.  So all you need to do is first prove that no simple sentence can ever be unbalanced (which should be pretty obvious, since simple sentences don't have any parentheses to begin with) and you also need to prove that no compound formula can be unbalanced (to do this, use a ""no infinite regress"" argument in order to show that any compound formula is ultimately reducible to simple sentences.  Since you'd have already proven that simple sentences can never be unbalanced then it also follows that compound formulas can never be unbalanced since it's common sense that the operators and the paired parentheses can't contribute anything to the imbalance, so the only thing that imaginably could contribute to the imbalance would be the simple sentences, but they can't.)  Since you'd have exhausted the options (simple sentences cannot be unbalanced; compound formulas also cannot be unbalanced) then you'd have proven that no formula can ever be unbalanced."

IMO math is very different from school math. It requires understanding proof methods, a bit of number theory and discrete math. None of these are typically part of high school math.

In all my 2.5 hour math exams, I usually finished all the questions with 45-60 minutes to spare. (that is how fast I was) Tried the IMO through the assistance of a teacher.

"new to math, and i want to ace IMO to secure a seat in highly prestigious math and statistics collages","Only six people per country get to the IMO. The competitors for these places have likely done competition maths for a while and usually also need a lot of raw talent. For all but the smallest countries, it's an unreasonable goal if you are just starting out.

That being said, taking part in maths competition can be a lot of fun if you enjoy maths. You get to meet other people who are passionate about maths, which is somewhat rare in the populace.

To prepare, you might want to look up some basic number theory (module arithmetic, prime numbers, divisibility rules, etc.), some geometry (theorems on triangles circles, erc), some combinatorics (permutations, binomial coefficients) and some general things (how to write a proof).
With that, you should try to solve some past problems of the competitions you plan to attend. Start with the earliest rounds and then slowly increase difficulty (even the easiest problems from the international round can be outrageously hard without enough experience)

So definitely do take part in maths competitions, but go in with reasonable expectations (i.e., not qualifying for the second round is somewhat likely). Have fun there, and don't bank your future on your success."

How to find the missing number in a sequence given three values and a constant?,"This doesn't make any sense yet.

It sounds from your description that 53 is the first term of the sequence, and then you add a number x to get 53 + x modulo 26 to equal 13.  There are any number of numbers that will do that.

Here you wrote the 53 as the second term of the sequence but the process you give for finding terms of the sequence always results in a  number not more than 25.  

And when you say 12 was 'originally' part of the sequence, what does that mean?  Which term was it?"
How to find the missing number in a sequence given three values and a constant?,"what does it mean to say that 26 is a constant? are 13 and 53 not also constants?

knowing the process you’ve written and the numbers 13, 53 and 26: knowing 53 is useless because your starting point is still a totally unknown number “y = 53+x”. knowing only that y is 13 more than some multiple of 26 is insufficient to determine y. any of these numbers could be y: 13, -13, 39, -39, 65, -65, 91, -91, …."
How to find the missing number in a sequence given three values and a constant?,"So you perform a bunch of known operation on an unknown number and get a known number? To get the number, you need to express the things you know as an equation(-s) in x and solve for x. You're probably suppised to arrive at something like:

13 = 65 - 52 = 65 - 26*2 = (53+x) - 26 * [(53+x)/26]

where [ ] is the rounding down function, but in this case the conditions say:
> The missing number (x) is added to 53, giving 65

So, 53 + x = 65 or x = 12. The rest of the conditions don't even matter here"

Write the equation out. Integer division `/` is crucial, since we cannot invert it:

    (x+53) - ((x+53)/26)*2  =  13    <=>    x+40  =  ((x+53)/26)*2

Consider both sides ""mod 2"" to find ""x = 0 (mod 2)"", i.e. we know ""x = 2y"" must be even for some ""y in Z"". Divide by ""2"" to eliminate the factor ""2"", and obtain

            y+20  =  (2y+53)/26        // ""/"" stands for integer division!

    <=>    2y+53  =  26*(y+20) + r     // r in {0; ...; 25}

    <=>      24y  =  -467 - r          // solve for ""y""

Consider the equation ""mod 24"" to find ""0 = 13-r (mod 24)"" -- the only integer solution ""0 <= r <= 25"" satisfying that is ""r = 13"". That leads to ""y = -20"" and the unique solution ""x = -40""."

What are negative exponents actually doing to a number?,"We usually learn that an **exponent** tells us how many times to multiply the **base** by itself.

Example: `3^5` (Read as ""3 to the power of 5"")

*   The **base** is 3.
*   The **exponent** is 5.
*   It means multiply 3 by itself 5 times: `3^5 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 243`

**NOTE:** Many people will informally call the entire numerical expression `3^5` an **exponent**, but that can make things confusing. For the purposes of this explanation, I am using the word **exponent** specifically to refer to the number *n* in expressions such as `x^n` (or ""*x* to the *n*th power""). For example, in `3^5`, I am using the word **exponent** to refer to the **5**.

Let's look at what happens when we multiply or divide by the base (which is 3 in our example):

*   **Multiply by the base (3):** The exponent **increases** by 1.

    `3^5 × 3 = 3^6`

    (The exponent goes up from 5 to 6.)

*   **Divide by the base (3):** The exponent **decreases** by 1.

    `3^5 ÷ 3 = 3^4`

    (The exponent goes down from 5 to 4.)

**This is the key pattern:**

*   Multiplying by the base adds 1 to the exponent.
*   **Dividing by the base subtracts 1 from the exponent.**

Let's *keep dividing* by the base (3) and see where this pattern takes us. Each time we divide by 3, the exponent should go down by 1:

*   `3^4 = 81`
*   `3^3 = 3^4 ÷ 3 = 81 ÷ 3 = 27` *(Exponent down from 4 to 3)*
*   `3^2 = 3^3 ÷ 3 = 27 ÷ 3 = 9` *(Exponent down from 3 to 2)*
*   `3^1 = 3^2 ÷ 3 = 9 ÷ 3 = 3` *(Exponent down from 2 to 1)*

Now, what happens if we divide by 3 *one more time*? The pattern continues: the exponent goes down by 1 (from 1 to 0).

*   `3^0 = 3^1 ÷ 3 = 3 ÷ 3 = 1` *(Exponent down from 1 to 0)*

Let's keep applying the exact same pattern: divide by the base (3) again, and the exponent decreases by 1 again (from 0 to -1).

*   `3^(-1) = 3^0 ÷ 3 = 1 ÷ 3 = 1/3` *(Exponent down from 0 to -1)*

We can keep going:

*   `3^(-2) = 3^(-1) ÷ 3 = (1/3) ÷ 3 = 1/9` *(Exponent down from -1 to -2)*
*   `3^(-3) = 3^(-2) ÷ 3 = (1/9) ÷ 3 = 1/27` *(Exponent down from -2 to -3)*

Look at the results we got by following the pattern:

*   `3^2 = 9` and `3^(-2) = 1/9`
*   `3^3 = 27` and `3^(-3) = 1/27`

In general, `3^(-y) = 1 / (3^y)`.

This gives us the general rule for negative exponents: `x^(-y) = 1 / (x^y)` (for any non-zero base `x`)

Examples:

*   `10^(-2) = 1 / (10^2) = 1/100`
*   `4^(-7) = 1 / (4^7)`

**Summary:** Multiplying by the base increases the exponent number by 1, and dividing by the base decreases the exponent number by 1. This is true whether the exponent number is positive, negative, or zero."

So multiplying corresponds to making the exponent bigger, and dividing corresponds to making it smaller.

What if I had started with 5\^2 and divided by 5\^3? What does the negative exponent mean?

5\^-1 is a number smaller than 1, a fraction. In fact, it's same same as just 1/5, since this is what we get when we take the 5\^2 and divide by 5\^3"
What are negative exponents actually doing to a number?,"An additional way beyond your correct idea is increasing/decreasing by orders of magnitude. 10^4 is +four orders of magnitude, 10^-4 is -4 orders of magnitude. This helps understand fractional and 0 exponents as well.

If the 10 is N instead then these are orders of magnitude in base N."
What are negative exponents actually doing to a number?,"Yes, you can think of it as repeated division. 

I Iike to start by explaining why we've defined 5^0 = 1

It's consistent if you think about going backwards, starting from some arbitrary power. Every time you go down a power you divide by the base instead of multiplying:

3^3 = 27

3^2 = 27/3 = 9

3^1 = 9/3 = 3

3^0 = 3/3 = 1

This makes more sense than what a lot of students intuitively expect, that it should =0.  But you have to remember that 3^0 is NOT 3*0, so it's just something different entirely.    Then negative exponents make sense because you can just continue the pattern, and they become repeated division.

3^-1 = 1/3

3^-2 = 1/3^2 = 1/9

Etc.

This allows for a nice consistency where, when you are multiplying, you can add and subtract exponents with the same base.

3^2 * 3^-2 = 3^2 / 3^2 = 1 

Or

3^2 * 3^-2 = 3^(2-2) = 3^0 = 1"
What are negative exponents actually doing to a number?,">Is it being divided by itself that many times?

Essentially. More precisely, it is **1** divided by the number that many times.

5^2 = 5 x 5

It's slightly complicated because logically, 5^0 acts like what you would assume 5^-1 would act like (and subsequently doesn't act like what you would assume 5^0 should act like). The reason 5^0 is 1 and not 0 is because 1 effectively becomes the numerator at that point, and any negative number becomes a fraction. (1/5 or 1/25, etc.) If 5^0 were 0, then 5^-1 would be 0/5, and 5^-2 would be 0/25, which simply doesn't make any sense."
What are negative exponents actually doing to a number?,Changing the base to the multiplicative inverse of itself.
What are negative exponents actually doing to a number?,"How I learned the field axioms from group theory up, there is a slight difference in how the minus sign was used

1) in the plus and times operation vs.

2) in the times and exponent operation.

Let me explain:

It all starts with the natural numbers, including 0. We can add two natural numbers and get another one: n + m = k. Then we find, there's this special number 0 which is neutral, because n + 0 = n. It remains the same number. That's all there is about natural numbers and addition. Only the 0 is special.

With natural numbers and multiplication we have m × n = k and only now we have another special number 1 that is neutral with the multiplication: m × 1 = m.

And also putting both + and × together we have m×(n+k) = m×n + m×k. That is called distributive property.

Now for that minus sign. So we have the integers which as we will see have the negative numbers, positive numbers and the number 0.

Up until now we only had 0 + 0 = 0. But what if we want two integers m and n which are not both 0 but still m + n = 0.

This is where for the first time the minus sign comes up. For example with the number 5 if there is an integer n such that 5 + n = 0 then this n is a unique integer and we call it -5. And with this we can define an operation - which is putting the minus sign between two integers like so m - n = k. And we define it with the + and the ....

Sorry I must stop now for this day.

Edit: Ok I'm back.

And we define it with the + and the × operations? I mean with the adding of the negative. 7 - 5 = 7 + (-5)

Or in general m - n = m + (-n)

What Vi Hart did in her very good video about logarithms is, she then divided the 7 into seven little ""+1""s and the -5 into five little ""-1""s like so

1+1+1+1+1+1+1 -1-1-1-1-1

And we see how each pair of +1 and -1 cancels each other out. And at the end we are left with 1+1 = 2.

But this is only a tool or when you insist to build up your natural numbers from the counting of +1. But that's not what we did. Remember, for addition the number 1 was not a very special number. It only became that special number once we introduced multiplication.

So there's nothing wrong to just separate the 7 into 2 + 5 and then with 2 + 5 - 5 = 2 + (5 + (-5)) = 2 + 0 = 2 we are much faster at our goal.

I think we can move to 2) multiplication and exponents now. But I will do it in another post."
What are negative exponents actually doing to a number?,repeated division instead of repeated multiplication.
What are negative exponents actually doing to a number?,"I think it's like this:

In real life, an exponent always needs to be an integer with a value of 2 or greater.  (For example, if we take k to be the side length, then we can make it into a square of area k\^2, or a cube of volume k\^3, and so on with the higher dimensions, but it doesn't make any sense for the exponent to be a non-integer nor does it make any sense for the exponent to be anything less than 2.)

However, if you plot all the ""real life"" exponents on a graph then you can draw a nice smooth curve connecting all the dots.  This allows us to know what the non-integer exponents should evaluate to, by way of a sort of interpolation I guess.

Then we can extend the curve leftwards to include the powers less than 2, I suppose on account of the symmetry.  (For example, somebody at some point must have discovered that the unknown negative powers of y = k\^x seem to coincide perfectly with the known positive powers of y=(1/k)\^x.  Anything else would result in an uglier curve which is therefore wrong.)

\-

edit - Or, as somebody else said, another way to think of it is with orders of magnitude.  Increasing the exponent by 1 is the same thing as multiplying by k whereas decreasing the exponent by 1 is the same thing as dividing by k."
What are negative exponents actually doing to a number?,"Positive exponents ""power up"" a number, negative exponents ""power down"" a number.

Geometrically you can think of adding or removing dimensions. A length of life turns into a square, a cube, etc., while in the other direction it's a cube turning into a square or length of line. 

(This is what is happening to the quantity, don't conflate dimensionality with the operation of raising to a power.)"
What are negative exponents actually doing to a number?,yes. Essentially we decide when extending the exponents outside positive that we want the rules f(x+y)=f(x)f(y) f(0)=0 anf f(mn)=f(m)\^n to hold even when we extend the domain of both the exponent and base. So a\^n a\^-n=1 or a\^-n=1/a\^n and similarly (a\^1/2)\^=a\^(1/2\*2)=a so a\^1/2=sqrt(a) and more generally (a\^p/q)\^q= a\^(pq/q)=a\^p and then adding continuity ie a\^(b+e)=\~=a\^b for small e and (a+e)\^b=\~=a\^b for small e enables us to extend to ways where the repeated multiplication definition falls apart namely because you cant mulltiply something by itself 1/2 time or pi times.
What are negative exponents actually doing to a number?,"##Tldr; it's not always obvious what a^b even means, so saying what exactly a^-b means is not possible in general. But, we can say that whatever a^b happens to mean, a^-b means undoing it in a multiplicative sense 

Most people here talk about positive bases and/or integer exponent. I'd like to add something that is more general because their explanations fail for non-positive numbers and non-integer exponents.

To give a problematic example, look at the expression (-1)^0.5 * (-1)^0.5  - you might try and calculate it as (-1)^(0.5 + 0.5) = (-1)^1 = - 1 or as (-1 * -1)^0.5 = 1^0.5 = 1. So clearly just to try and make the nice exponent rules work and generalising from there is problematic. A priori it might not be obvious that these problems can't arise for your question. So just saying a^(-n) * a^n = a^0 = 1 therefore a^(-n) = 1/a^n is not a particularly robust way to think about it. It might be worth investing the little bit of extra effort now to try and find a robust way to think about exponentiation. 

So in general we only know how to do a^b for positive integer values of b. There is one other exception though. The exponential function exp(b) = e^b is not defined through this intuition, but as a power series : exp(x) = 1 + x + x^2 / 2 + x^3 / 6... Note that x is only ever raised to positive integer powers in here which is something we know how to do and interpret for anything we can multiply!

So how can we relate other exponentiation to the exponential function? Well a^x = exp(log(a))^x = exp(log(a) * x). So if we can define a logarithm we cracked the code. log(a) simply is one of values x such that exp(x) = a where one value is selected by convention if there are multiple choices available.

OK so we now have a way to do exponentiation for anything that the exponential function can produce (which is a huge class of objects, and certainly any real number). But what does exp(x) *mean*?

That's a question with a million different great answers. One of my favorites is from [3 blue 1 brown in this video](https://youtu.be/O85OWBJ2ayo?si=qjmVRUrdKyEyJkJx) don't be afraid of the matrices it's about the idea that exp relates two different types of transformations! 

For real numbers exp takes numbers you add (so shifting along the real line) and produces numbers you want to multiply (so scaling). But it also preserves structure. Exp(a+b) = exp(a) * exp(b) (assuming that + and * commute which for reals they do). -x is the inverse of x under addition, it means undoing whatever x does. So exp(-x) means undoing exp(x). When looking back at a^b and a^-b with a=exp(x) we get exp(b*x) and exp(-b*x). Whatever a^b is, a^-b is undoing that in the sense of multiplication. For the nice cases of a^b it's just a nice real number and so undoing it in a multiplying sense just means 1/a^b

But now you have an understanding of a^-b that even works for things like a being a rotation and b being a shift or complex numbers or whatever. In mathematics terms exp relates the lie algebra with the corresponding lie group and exponentiation is interpreted in terms of this. Lie theory is one of the most fundamental and interesting building blocks of both mathematics and physics so it's cool that we can get an insight into it from taking a simple question like yours seriously."

What are negative exponents actually doing to a number?,"So raising to an exponent is really multiplying/dividing 1 by the base however many times the exponent is. So 3^2 isn’t 3 x 3, it’s 1x3x3. For positive exponents this is the same as multiplying the base by itself that many times, but for 0 or lower exponents it makes it more clear, 3^0 is just 1 multiplied by 3, 0 times, aka just 1. And then ya negative is dividing that many times, so 3^-2 is 1/3/3 = 1/9.

What are negative exponents actually doing to a number?,"Division. Division is multiplication inverse. The negative exponent is simply ""divided by n times"". Positive (multiplication): 2\^1 = 1 x 2 = 2;  2\^2 = 1 x 2 x 2 = 4;  2\^3 = 1 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 8... Negative exponents indicate the opposite (division): 2\^-1 = 1 / 2 = 1/2; 2\^-2 = 1 / 2 / 2 = 1/4; 2\^-3 = 1 / 2 / 2 / 2 = 1/8.

That's why 2\^4 x 2\^-4 = 2\^0 = 1, you are multiplying by 2 four times and dividing by 2 four times."
What are negative exponents actually doing to a number?,"So, lets imagine that we're making a table where we translate these exponents to the resultant multiplication problem. Let's do powers of two since they're super easy.

2^4 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 16
2^3 = 2 * 2 * 2     = 8
2^2 = 2 * 2         = 4
2^1 = 2 * 1         = 2
2^0 = 1             = 1
```

So what would you think would happen if you went lower than this? Well, you would turn the number into a division problem. 

```
2^-1 = 1 / 2         = 1/2
2^-2 = 1 / (2 * 2)   = 1/4
```

So forth, and so on. This has to be the case, because with multiplication, the ""do nothing"" operation is to multiply by 1. For addition and subtraction, it's adding or subtracting 0. So, when you get to 2^0 or anything to the zeroth power, you get ""1"". then the negative exponents basically divide by 2 to the power you specify.

So 2^8 = 256... but 2^-8 = 1/256"
What are negative exponents actually doing to a number?,"Short answer, division

Longer explanation -

An important thing for this explanation is the identity property of multiplication. That is, any number multiplied by 1 is itself. For example 3² = 1•3² = 9

When doing 3² a simple way to think about what you're really doing is as multiplying 1, by 3, two times, or 1•3•3 = 9

This makes 3^-2 more intuitive, because then you can say you're multiplying 1, by 3, *negative* two times. And what is the inverse of multiplication? Division. So you're really dividing 1, by 3, two times, to get ⅑."

What you have to do here is spell out what the symbols mean.  W(p,q,t) means that p plays against q in game t and wins.  So, for instance, W(Rob, John, Bill) doesn't make any sense, unless Bill is the name of a game somehow, and similarly, W(9am, Rob, John) doesn't make any sense either.  But W(Rob, John, 9am) means that Rob wins the game against John that took place at 9am.

  
So now work through the quantifiers:

\- there exists t such that W(p,q,t) means what?  Try replacing p and q with Rob and John: there exists t such that W(Rob, John, t).  What does this mean?

\- Then try to move to the next quantifier: there exists q and there exists t such that W(Rob, q, t).  What does that mean?

  
The one you selected says that for every player, there is another player they ALWAYS win against.  That would be written as for all p, there exists q such that for any game t, W(p,q,t).

What do you do when you can't understand a math topic (or even explanations on that topic)  AT ALL?,"This is going to sound dumb, but I’ll say it anyway … Literally sound out each word and ask yourself about what you hear.

When you hear the word “Taylor series,” you might ask …

* Who is Taylor?

* What is a “series”?

Then you can probably brainstorm some more in-depth questions, like …

* Are there series that *aren’t* Taylor series? 

* What’s so special about Taylor series that people gave them a special name?

* What are Taylor series used for?

* What year was this concept first invented?

* What are the most important examples?

* Are there any misbehaved examples worth knowing about?

Hopefully that makes sense. The key is to write down *lots of questions*, then try to skim textbooks to find your answers. Most students do the opposite — they read the entire section and then do exercises after — this is a bad habit. Start with a question, then search for the answer.

—

Here’s a justification, if you’re interested:

Based on your OP, it sounds like you’re reading explanations and hoping they make sense. But if you think about it, this isn’t really an efficient way to acquire information.

Example: Suppose you need to know the definition of a random word, say “kerfluffle.” Would you go to the dictionary and start reading from page 1? No! You skip to the “K” section and retrieve the information you need.

Example: Suppose your car breaks down and a red light flashes on the dashboard, and you don’t know what it means. Do
you read the entire car manual from start to finish? No! You start with a question— “what does that red light mean?” — then look at the table of contents and skip to the part with the information you need.

That’s how humans obtain information. They don’t start at the top and read linearly. They start with a question, then skip, skim, search, and retrieve. If you read something *without any goal or question*, your brain will not have any way to categorize the information, and you won’t retain it."
What do you do when you can't understand a math topic (or even explanations on that topic)  AT ALL?,"First I absolutely cannot recommend /u/Depnids recommendation of watching [this 3b1b video](https://youtu.be/3d6DsjIBzJ4?feature=shared) enough for understanding Taylor Series' specifically. Calc has always been one of my favorite classes, I understood it really well the first time through, and that video (and the broader series it's a part of) still completely reshaped my relationship with calc. Truly, it's the most intuitive possible way of understanding Taylor Series.

To answer your question more generally, though:

I think you're struggling with something very natural, which is that *you need to know math pretty well to understand proofs but, paradoxically, you also need proofs to understand math.* You're kind of at the inflection point where classes shift from learning topics with some amount of 'and here's how it works, you'll learn why later' to all of the 'here's why all that works.' Calc is really one of the last classes you'll typically take that introduces really any new concepts without also rigorously proving them for you. And, really, that's the answer to your question, because going off of a proofs-based framework for math makes ""understanding"" a topic very binary: either you understand the proof of a topic/concept in which case you understand the topic, or you can't understand the proof in which case you can point to the confusing part of the proof so that you can go find the proof for that confusing part so you can understand it better, etc.

If you're learning Taylor Series right now I imagine you haven't taken any proofs-based classes yet and, if that's the case, this explanation probably sounds confusing or half-baked and that's OK, but trust when I say it really is a complete answer. Learning formal proofs gives a framework for **knowing** beyond a shadow of a doubt that something is mathematically true and, if you're comfortable enough with the way proofs are constructed, understanding that proof really is as identical as you can get to understanding the concept.

To loop all the way back around, I think the 3b1b is so effective because it effectively just walks through an incredibly thorough, intuitive proof of why Taylor Series approximate their root function and how/why that's useful"
What do you do when you can't understand a math topic (or even explanations on that topic)  AT ALL?,"This is where you really need to speak to a good teacher, 1:1.  And in their explanation be ready to say ""wait, I don't understand"" as soon as you don't, so they can get to the root of what's holding you up. 

Looking at some simple examples of whatever it is may help.  

Sometimes just resting a topic and coming back to it on a different day."
What do you do when you can't understand a math topic (or even explanations on that topic)  AT ALL?,"It always always comes down to understating the prerequisites.

If you understand the pre well enough, the course will naturally follow on. It will even answer some questions you had at the end of the pre.

In your defence, it is very normal to feel confused in university level courses. Often, the prerequisites came right before the thing you are confused about, and you have not yet had the time to digest them before being fed the next thing."
What do you do when you can't understand a math topic (or even explanations on that topic)  AT ALL?,For me it’s finding ways to organize the information and developing the intuition. Taking my own notes and watch a bunch of different explanations
What do you do when you can't understand a math topic (or even explanations on that topic)  AT ALL?,What’s a limit
What do you do when you can't understand a math topic (or even explanations on that topic)  AT ALL?,"Start reading from the beginning. At the first word you don't fully understand, stop reading and go to basic books to learn that concept until you fully understand it, and then go back to the main text and carry on reading until the next word/concept you don't understand and go clarify that, etc. Keep doing that."
What do you do when you can't understand a math topic (or even explanations on that topic)  AT ALL?,"When stuck, I had three preliminary approaches in high school, college, and graduate school:

A) Read: I go over my notes, my textbook (this was enough for most of high school), other textbooks online and in a library if I have access to a graduate-level math department's resources, Wikipedia, and so on. I would look for any relevant content and examples, and if I could find a solutions manual, even better because they often would include explanations that were never covered for harder problems in class. Working on easier problems did not help me at all for novel variants that were totally unfamiliar.

B) Ask: I would go to instructors and TA's and ask questions. Some were more helpful than others. I would also consult peers to see if they had figured something out that was vexing me.

C) SSR: Scribble, stare, and pray. I would rewrite and redo the problems a few times until I reached the point where I got stuck. It really sucked when I didn't even know where to begin. I wasted soooo much paper trying to rewrite proofs and spent hours thinking about problems with no hint in sight. I would pray to God for an answer. After about 10 to 20 hours of struggle, I would have random epiphanies, and the answers would suddenly materialize. This started happening with upper-level proof classes, and it reminded me of Henri Poincaré's article on Mathematical Creation, but decades later after starting formal meditation practices in my 30's, I am more convinced than ever before that it was a blessing obtained through all of the praying and receiving answers subconsciously from the Divine. It was a highly stressful period, but it helped me develop into a stronger math student with practice and repetition.

Nowadays, I know all of those methods were whack. I should have hired a tutor and spent less time stressing myself out and compromising my sleep."
What do you do when you can't understand a math topic (or even explanations on that topic)  AT ALL?,"Something that helps guide me when I’m lost in a topic is aiming to get to the point where I could teach it to someone else.

Usually that means getting a more thorough understanding of the prerequisites. If something feels too far above your head to grasp, look at your feet, not your hands: you’re probably standing on foundations that are too short.

Working with peers and trying to solve homework together can be extremely useful for this—different people will vary a lot in their ways of thinking, their background skills, where they get stuck, and what questions they ask. I have a much better understanding of the topics that I’ve had to teach to many people, whose thinking is sometimes very different from mine.

Nowadays for me more often this means trying to write proofs, typically using a proof assistant or programming language—if my explanation is simple enough that even a computer can understand it, then I *probably* understand it well enough to move forward."
Good Resource on Category Theory,"Emily Riehl, _Category Theory in context_ is imo one of the best introductions to CT out there, especially if you want to actually get into it and not just learn the basic definitions. 

(It's not a problem if you don't get examples she gives, because there are plenty that you will get. She shows how ubiquitous some notions are.)

In general, Riehl is for me one of those people that writes very readable expositions and papers, if you are interested in more CT afterwards."
How to cover all the necessary materials and content for both AMC 12 and AIME,"Stop over-planning. I made this mistake too when I first started competition math. This year, I almost made USAJMO with an 8 on AIME, since I did USAMTS. I got a 5 last year.

Literally, just do problems. Do AIME problems and HMMT problems and whatever problems until you feel your head hurt. The theory for AIME isn’t particular difficult. I would say the content in intermediate algebra and precalculus is enough for algebra (I didn’t really do these books, but the material itself is good). For geometry, just understand all of the computational formulas and do a ton of computational geometry problems from various contests. Number theory doesn’t show up very much on AIME anymore, but knowing stuff like the basics, CRT, special functions, and modular arithmetic is enough for the two problems where it’ll appear. The only theory you really need for combo is recursion and some stuff about probability and expected value; the rest is just problem solving, the basics, and practice. I would avoid paying for any resources that aren’t Alphastar, AoPS, AMSP, or Evan Chen stuff. There’s no silver bullet for improving. Just do problems.

For practice taking tests, go to as many college competitions as possible. I went to tournaments at Berkeley, Princeton, Caltech, MIT, and CMU this year.

Also, unless you got above a 200 index this year, you realistically won’t make USAMO next year unless you get really lucky or you’re just super talented. I tried making USAJMO in 2 years and I narrowly missed it this year, and making USAMO is much more difficult. I still wish you good luck."
Moving from calculus to multi variable and differential equations,"It's an entirely natural progression, multivariate calculus and differential equations both just build on the existing rules of differential and integral calculus 

For example, the partial derivative is a concept that gets introduced in multivariate calculus, which is calculated quite literally as the derivative w.r.t a single variable in the function while treating every other variable as constant

So let's say you have some function f(x,y)=x^(2)y^(2). Then the partial derivative ∂f/∂x (we use ∂ instead of d for partial derivatives) is 2xy^(2), because we treated y^(2) as being a constant and differentiated strictly w.r.t x

Differential equations on the other hand is more just a different approach to the same concepts that you covered in calculus, where, instead of being told a function f(x), you're told the derivative and have to calculate the original function, with the only complication being that the derivative may be represented as a function of the original function i.e. df/dx=xf(x) 

So with both of those in mind, make sure that you are really comfortable with the concepts you've learned in and prior to calculus because you're going to be using all of them."
Natural feeling symbolic math software,"Have you tried one of the (many) other computer algebra system instead? They will be likely be able to do any math you need up to (and including) university.

How to use math books?,"We all approach things differently. For me multiple reads are the key. Sometimes I think I have a concept on the first pass. Sometimes it takes two or three.

Then exercises. They test understanding. Much of the time they confirm and solidify understanding but sometimes I try an exercise and realise that I haven't fully understood what was being taught. So, armed with the new information I return to the explanation. 

Most of the time that is enough but, if I am still struggling at that point it's time to take a break, go for a walk, sleep on it, whatever. My brain does a lot of processing when I'm not actively asking it to. When I return to the explanation and example it will often be with a new perspective and will just click. 

If I don't get it at this point then it's time to look for another source that will explain it differently. 

Now this might sound like a long process but, bear in mind that a lot of things might be covered by: read explanation, do example and never get to the later stages of trying to wrap my head around something that I am struggling with.

Hope this helps. Good luck."
How to use math books?,"I go to the questions first.  See if I can already do them.  Chances are I can do a few.  I get stuck eventually, so now I am clear what I have to read to understand.  This works as long as you already have some clue - for example you have covered the material in class.

Unfortunately in my view, often text books do the interesting stuff for you.  Say the derivation of formulas.  You read it, but that is not going to stick.  So you have to do this on your own, and not using the text.

It is always easier to understand material, if you already understand most of the material you are reading.  This is why you should read books  this backwards way."
How to use math books?,"Math books are tricky, so you aren't wrong to ask this.  Here's what I do:

1) Read a section canonically as it is written, until I get to the exercises.

2) Do the exercises.  See if I get the ideas.  If I don't, go back and look for a clear explanation of what went wrong.

3) Every now and then, go back through the chapters and ask if I clearly understand what it is about, headline by headline.  Make sure it all looks recognizable.

In my experience, math books are pretty good at explaining somewhere which sections are core knowledge and which aren't.  It helps to have a study interest in mind so you have a clue which parts of what you're studying are most directly applicable to the thing that interests you.  You should skip sections if they are marked as optional AND you don't feel an urge to look into them - you can save those for later and revisit if you need to.

Math books are incredibly dense.  It's normal to read a 10-page span like its 100 pages long in pursuit of building intuition."
How to use math books?,"You should read the book and work the examples. The examples will be much more clear if you read the explainations. You don't have to do every exercise, but you should do a few of every type of exercise, and if you have the time and the will to do them all it won't hurt.

Each section of the book is organized as logically as possible to try to lead you into an understanding of the material. Read it thoroughly, but don't get bogged down. If you don't understand something right away come back to it later."

Is Khan Academy sufficient to learn elementary algebra and calculus?,"It's good enough for an overview.  If you get 100% on it, then you'll be far ahead of your peers, but might still pick up some more information from a full course where there is more practice volume, edge case discussion, application and multi-skill integration (Khan tends to test individual skills and not multiple in one problem).

Again, this is a very valuable exercise.

If you got slightly below average grades, then you may be correct that the issue is mostly just your conscientiousness (aka how careful you are in reading questions, carefully doing each step of the problem, and then reviewing your work after you come to the answer).  That is trainable.

If you want to go from 'good' to 'great' in Algebra though, then you should also consider doing some volume of practice in the AOPS Alcumus (tricky, adaptive) exercise bank, start from Pre-Algebra and then do Algebra 1, trying to get every skill to 'green' or above.

Is Khan Academy sufficient to learn elementary algebra and calculus?,"Great to hear of your interest in math (including calculus!) given that your young age.

To do that, I separated the content that dealt with function families you don't cover at all -- or very little of -- in algebra classes: exponentials, logarithms, and trigonometric functions. (Typically, these are covered in precalculus classes.) Calculus Simplified accomplishes that, enabling you to learn calculus in the context of only ""algebraic functions,"" which is the focus of algebra courses in middle/early high school. Flip through the book at a bookstore, your local library, or look through the first chapter of it on my site (https://sites.google.com/view/fernandezmath/books/calculus-simplified). I hope it helps."

How do you square/sqaure root recurring decimals?,"I've addressed the problem with your solution to the rectangle problem, but answering the more general question, work using fractions and the √ sign, and only use a calculator at the end if you need a numerical value.

eg suppose you have a right-angled triangle with sides 320/3 and 160/3  (don't write them as decimals 106.666... and 53.333...).  Then if x is the hypotenuse:

x^2 = (320/3)^2 + (160/3)^2 

x^2 = (320^2 + 160^(2)) / 3^2

x^2 = 128000 / 3^2

x = √128000 / 3

If you want to go further 128000 = 2^10 * 5^3

Is there any technique to solve these equations?,"Haiii :3333 I’m Brazilian too!
I’m going to write the response once in English, and once in Portuguese (so both can read this well).
English:
So, the problem with these kinds of equations is that they tend to not have a generalized formula. For a Quintic and above there isn’t, and if you start doing these equations with root(x) in it, it can get even harder. The most you could do is put the root on one side and square the whole equation. Unfortunately that gives you an even higher degree equation so you’re going to have problems with it. The equations you put by themselves aren’t that difficult, but finding a general method is hard for anything more difficult than that. I’m going to put the solution for both as a comment to this comment.
Portuguese:
Entao, o problema é que pra essas equações mais dificeis, Nao tem Uma solucao geral. Até para a de quinto grau Nao existe. Quando tem só Uma raiz, as vezes da para vc deixar a raiz de um lado e colocar tudo ao quadrado. Para a 1 e 2 que vc colocou eu vou comentar Uma soluçao"
Is there any technique to solve these equations?,"For the first one, I agree with the other comment. You should isolate the square root and square both sides. That should give you x\^4 - 4x\^2 - x + 4 = 0. You pointed out that 1 is a solution. That's a great observation! Thus the polynomial can be factored by x-1, and it should give you P = x\^4 - 4x\^2 - x + 4 = (x-1)\*Q where Q is some polynomial of degree 3. You calculate that Q equals x\^3 + x\^2 - 3x - 4. The solutions to the equation are 1 and the roots of the third degree polynomial I just showed.

But remember, as we are talking about the equation x\^2 + sqrt(x) - 2 = 0, we have sqrt(x) = 2 - x\^2, but sqrt(x) >= 0, so 2 - x\^2 >= 0, so x² <= 2, so x < sqrt(2).

If you plot Q(x), you should see that the only real root is around 1.83 (which is larger than sqrt(2)\~=1.41), so the roots of the polynomial Q are not solutions to the first equation. Let's prove it (using calculus).

Remember that Q(x) = x\^3 + x\^2 - 3x - 4. Then Q'(x) = 3x\^2 + 2x - 3. That is a second degree equation, you know how to solve it and x1 = (-2-sqrt(40))/6, x2 = (-2+sqrt(40))/6. This polynomial (Q') is convex, meaning it is positive when x is very low (towards minus infinity) and very high (towards plus infinity).

So the polynomial is positive after the second root. If you evaluate Q at its roots, you will find something negative for both. Since the polynomial Q is increasing until the first root, decreasing between the two roots and increasing after, a positive result can only be obtained after the second root (x2). And you can see that sqrt(2) gives a negative output by the polynomial Q. Therefore positive reals under sqrt(2) cannot be solutions to the equation.

The only solution is 1.

I suck at remembering math concepts and solving equations,"> I’ve always figured it was because I never really “understood” the concept but just recognizing patterns based on how our teacher would solve previous equations. 

Yep. A ton of people do this, because it's the easiest way through.

The best way to learn math is to *understand* why it's true - which you can do by exploring the ideas. Play around with things, try and see what happens with different numbers. What happens if you do things a technically correct but different way - do you get the same results? If there are conditions on when something happens, what happens when you break those conditions?

Once you understand the underlying logic - you know not just *that* something is true, but you know why it *must* be true - it's a *lot* harder to forget it."

How to prove by induction that 5n^3 + 7n is divisible by 6?????,"Let ""f(n) = 5n^3 + 7n"". The base case holds, since ""f(0) = 0"" is divisible by 6. Note

    f(n+1)  =  f(n) + 15*n(n+1) + 12    // ""n(n+1)"" is even for all ""n in Z""

Can you take if from here?"
How to prove by induction that 5n^3 + 7n is divisible by 6?????,"Note that n²+n=n(n+1). Either n or n+1 is even, so you always have an even number."
How to prove by induction that 5n^3 + 7n is divisible by 6?????,Not sure by induction but that expression is equivalent to n-n^3 mod 6 which is n(n-1)(n+1) which is clearly divisble by 2 and by 3 because it's the product of 3 consecutive numbers
How to prove by induction that 5n^3 + 7n is divisible by 6?????,"By using modular arithmetic. 

5n³+7n mod 6
=5n³+n mod 6 which we want to be 0

This is clearly true for n=0. Now we do our inductive step:

5(n+1)³+(n+1)
= 5n³+3n²+4n
= 3n²+3n mod 6 by inductive hypothesis
= 3n(n+1)

Which is 3 times a product of consecutive numbers, one of which must be even, hence a factor of 6 and so = 0 mod 6."
How to prove by induction that 5n^3 + 7n is divisible by 6?????,"Base case: let n=1, then 5(1)^3 + 7(1) =12 which is clearly divisible by 12.

Induction step: assume 5n^3 + 7n is divisible by 6, which means there exists some number k such that 5n^3 + 7n = 6k 

Now, let’s look at what we can do with 5(n+1)^3 + 7(n+1). I’d start by expanding everything:

5(n+1)^3 + 7(n+1) = 5(n+1)(n+1)(n+1)+7n+7 

= 5(n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n + 1) + 7n+7 

= 5n^3 + 15n^2 + 15n + 5 + 7n + 7

= (5n^3 + 7n) + 12 + 15n^2 + 15n

= 6k+ 12 + 5n(3n+3)

Now we just need to show that 5n(3n+3) is divisible by 6 for all n. 

If n is even, then there is a j such that n=2j. So we have 5(2j)(3•2j+3)=10j(6j+3)= 60j^2 +30 = 6(10k^2 +5)

If n is odd, then we have some j where n=2j+1. So we have 5(2j+1)(3(2j+1)+3)= (10j+5)(6j+3+3)= 60j^2 + 90j+30 = 6(10j^2 + 15j + 5)

So 5n(3n+3) is divisible by 6 for all n, so let us write 5n(3n+3)= 6g, g is a natural number.

So we have 6k+ 12 + 5n(3n+3) = 6k+12 + 6g = 6(k+2+g) which clearly is divisible by 6 which concludes the proof."

How to prove by induction that 5n^3 + 7n is divisible by 6?????,"If you have to use induction, 

5(n+1)^3 + 7(n+1) - 5n^3 - 7n = 15 n^2 + 15 n + 12

And as noted above, n^2 + n = n(n+1) which is the product of adjacent numbers, so one is even and the other is odd."
How to prove by induction that 5n^3 + 7n is divisible by 6?????,"You know it's divisible by 6 for n = 0.

Now, assume 5n^3 + 7n is divisible by 6. In other words, 5n^3 + 7n = 6a for some integer a.

Now prove that 5(n+1)^3 + 7(n+1) is divisible by 6.

Expand 5(n+1)^3 + 7(n+1) and try to rewrite it using 5n^3 + 7n in some way. In general,

(5n^3 + 7n)k + b = 5(n+1)^3 + 7(n+1)

Since 5n^3 + 7n = 6a

6ak + b = 5(n+1)^3 + 7(n+1)

You know by assumption that a is an integer. Pick k to be an integer (might be 1 in the simplest case). Now prove b is divisible by 6.

Solve for b as a function of n. That is, expand 5(n+1)^3 + 7(n+1), subtract (5n^3 + 7n)k for your chosen k. The result will be a polynomial in n. It will probably be pretty easy to prove that polynomial is divisible by 6.

Technically, I think you have to repeat for 5(n-1)^3 + 7(n-1) if you want to prove it for all integers n, not just non-negative integers n."
How to prove by induction that 5n^3 + 7n is divisible by 6?????,"Base step: n=1: 5+7=12=6\*2. Easy.

Recursive/induction step: if 5n^3 + 7n is divisible by 6, prove 5(n+1)^3 + 7(n+1) is divisible by 6. It suffices to show their difference is divisible by 6. Knowing the binomial theorem and Pascal's triangle you should get that (n+1)^3 is n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n + 1, so 5(n+1)^3 + 7(n+1) is 5(n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n + 1) + 7(n+1). Simplify, combine like terms, find the difference between that and 5n^3 + 7n, and prove that difference is divisible by 6."

How to prove by induction that 5n^3 + 7n is divisible by 6?????,"Step 1 do induction setup

Step 2 
5(n+1)^(3)+7=5(n^(3)+3n^(2)+3n+1)+7=5n^(3)+15n^(2)+15n+5+7=5n^(3)+15n^(2)+15n+12

5n^(3) is divisible by 6 due to the induction step

15n^(2)+15n+12=3(5n^(2)+5n+4)

Case 1 n is even
Then 5n^(2), and 5n are even So the sum is even

Case 2 n is odd 
Then 5n^(2) and 5n are odd and so their sum is even thus the whole sum is even

Thus 3(5n^(2)+5n+4) is even. And it's obviously divisible by 3 therefore it is divisible by 6


You could also argue 
5n^(2)+5n=5n(n+1) will be even since either 5n or n+1 will be even and so the product will be even as well."

How to prove by induction that 5n^3 + 7n is divisible by 6?????,"its easier to use mod instead of induction. there are just 2 cases: n is odd and n is even


for even n, since n is a factor of both 5n^3 and 7n so the whole thing is even.


for odd n, 5n^3 is odd, and 7n is also odd, and odd+odd=even


so for all integers n, 5n^3 +7n is even


combine that with how you got its divisible by 3 and then itll be divisible by 6"

"College Algebra: using 2π, π, or π/2 for angles.","2π is a whole circle, so 360°.

π is a half circle, 180°, so in many cases we restrict angles to -π<x≤π.

π/2 is a right angle, or a quarter circle."
"College Algebra: using 2π, π, or π/2 for angles.","Instead of using degrees to measure angles which come from arbitrarily slicing a circle into 360 pieces, you can use radians which have a much more natural origin; a radian is just the number of radii which fit around the arc with some angle, the radius of a circle fits around its circumference 2pi times, pi radians is then half the circumference (180°) and pi/2 is a quarter (90°)."
"College Algebra: using 2π, π, or π/2 for angles.","Responding to the edit: in most contexts, if you add a full turn (360° or 2π radians) to an angle, you get an angle which is functionally the same, in that it has all the same trigonometric values. (The main exception to this is when plotting curves in polar coordinates when the angle term appears outside of trig functions, such as with spirals.)

This means that if you have, say, sin(x)=0.5, you know that there's a principal value of x=π/6, another value at π-π/6=5π/6, but then you can add or subtract any whole multiple of 2π and get another solution.

This becomes very important when dealing with complex numbers in polar form. If I have a complex number expressed as modulus r and argument t, it may be necessary to write it as re^(it+2πik) (noting that e^(2πi)=1) because if I take the complex log or raise the value to a non-integer power, that 2πik term will suddenly start providing additional solutions."

"College Algebra: using 2π, π, or π/2 for angles.","Two pi is a complete rotation.

A lot of students have ""degree brain"" in that they only think of angle measures in terms of degrees. Just like inches and centimeters are different systems. If you insist on one system mentally you're not going to be able to handle other systems.

Early on you may think of 360° as a circle. Then you go to math class and 2pi is a circle. Then in astronomy 1,296,000 arcseconds are a circle. Join the Army as an artillery soldier and 6400 mils is a circle. Then become an engineer and 400 gradiens is a circle. Then you start to understand that the world isn't just measuring angles in degrees.

The ""plus 2pi\*N"" part is saying that whatever angle *X* between 0° and 360° that satisfies the equation, so does *X* \+ 360° or *X* \+ 720° and so on. It's expressing all the different angles which are the same in a way such that n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

For example sine of 30° is 0.5 so *sin(30°) = 0.5*. But sine of 390° also equals 0.5. And so does sine of -330°. So what's a compact way to say that all those are equal? The answer is *sin(30°+n\*360°)=0.5* where n=...-2, -1, 0, 1, 2... .

And if 30° is pi/6 and 360° is 2pi this becomes: *sin(pi/6+n\*2pi)*"

They are measurements of specific angles that look very different. 12” and 1’ are the same (always), 100% and 1 are the same (when multiplying), 180° and π are the same (when measuring angles).

Can you give examples of specific problems you’re having difficulty with? My guess is that your issue is actually with not understanding sine or cosine."

It kind of makes sense, you can't build a thing 38 degrees (long?) (far?) (what?). There really isn't a physical manifestation of degree. However a circle one cubit in diameter is π cubits around. (This is why π can be found in the dimensions of the pyramids.) Half, quarter, or any part of a circle now has a physical measurement associated with it.

Right, so probability is determined by the number of relevant possibilities for what you want divided by the number of all possibilities. Also observe that in your problem, you are not bothered about the order in which they are drawn. So use binomial coefficients.

Failing to draw four of a kind: That means either 0, 1, 2 or 3 jacks among the 26 cards you draw. This means drawing 26, 25, 24 or 23 non-jacks, respectively. So the number of relevant possibilities (call it R) is:

R = (12 choose 0) * (36 choose 26) + (12 choose 1) * (36 choose 25) + (12 choose 2) * (36 choose 24) + (12 choose 3) * (36 choose 23).

The total number of possibilities (call it A) is just 

A = (48 choose 26).

Pythagorean Theorem Disproved?,"Ahhhh visual proofs... 3blue1brown recently did a great video on the challenge with visual proofs [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYQVlVoWoPY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYQVlVoWoPY)

but separately, lets assume that your diagram is drawn accurately and to scale.  Your inner white space is not a square or rectangle, but a rhombus (equilateral quadrilateral of side length c). The area of the rhombus is half of the product of the diagonals.  You already correctly identified the lengths of the sides (2a and 2b) which are also the lengths of the diagonals.  (2a\*2b)/2 = 2ab = 24.

similarly you could think of that inner space as 4 right triangles of 3-4-5.  which happens to be the same value you calculated with the blue triangles.  Which is also 24.

lastly, i think there's many great proofs for pythagorean theorem.  My favorite visual one is the proof by rearrangement which is what i think you were trying for

Math is actually very fun (but here’s my problem),"Part of the difficulty is that the historical, chronological, *story* of the development of mathematics, is quite different from the pedagogy of *learning* mathematics, and it's not that easy to marry the two approaches in a way which doesn't fail at both goals. Many times in math history we've had someone first invent the incredibly ugly, byzantine, wildly convoluted version of a groundbreaking math idea, and then someone came along a bit later (or the same person came back to their own work) and restated it in a far more elegant way, with better notation and a conceptual framework which is more powerful, less arbitrary, easier to follow. And telling the story in this order makes for a better story, but if you're a math student trying to master the concept, it may be a lot more useful to go the other way around.

And there's the issue of accessibility. Math education tends to build upon its own foundations; chapter 2 builds on chapter 1's concepts and so on, so if you skip ahead you're liable to be pretty lost; but popularizers and storytellers about the human history of math, are generally aiming to reach a wider range of ability levels. Someone trying to tell the story of Henri Poincaré's life to a general audience, can't afford to tell the reader ""You must already be deeply familiar with the works of Hamilton, Riemann and Minkowsky in order to understand this story."" Their target audience would be a tiny sliver of humanity.

So, the books which get deep into the actual mathematical abstractions tend to be pretty light on human storytelling, and the books which tell the stories of mathematicians and math history, tend to gloss over all the technicalities.

One beloved classic comes to mind though: *Godel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid* by Douglas Hofstadter. It touches on a variety of topics from foundational number theory, computing science and computability theory, Boolean logic, set theory and so on, and weaves them together with ideas from philosophy, psychology, art and music, in a very playful and engaging way. It doesn't engage super deeply with the stories of the great mathematicians, and doesn't concern itself too much with historical accuracy, but it *is* written with a great abundance of storytelling *style*. And it also (IMHO) pays a very nice homage to the maths-and-fantasy writing of Lewis Carroll."

By pure PEMDAS as I and many others were taught in school, the division should be done first because it's on the left. However, the multiplication here is a special notational case of multiplication called ""multiplication by juxtaposition,"" meaning there's no explicit multiplication symbol, and in some circles that is viewed as having priority over division, even if the division is on the left.

Multiplications and divisions are simply done in whatever order they are encountered moving from left to right.  So 6/2(3) is interpreted as 6 / 2 \* 3.  Working from left to right, 6 / 2 = 3, and then 3 \* 3 = 9.

Note that writing equations like this in a completely linear fashion is done purposely to allow multiple interpretations to gin up controversy and earn fake internet points.  In any actual mathematical or scientific setting, equations are written to make the intended meaning unambiguous.

6/2(3) is a division and a multiplication. The way to evaluate that is left to right, so it's (6/2)\*3, or 9.

Which answer is correct depends on which notational convention the original author intended you to use for implicit multiplication.

**Conventions**

There are two common approaches to how implicit multiplication (multiplication indicated by juxtaposing expressions) should be handled when it comes to order of operations.

Explicit multiplication (multiplication indicated by a specific symbol like • or ×) has the same precedence as division. This makes sense since division can be thought of as a form of multiplication — multiplication by the reciprocal. So we *always* perform division and *explicit* multiplication in the order in which they appear from left to right.

(The idea that explicit multiplication comes before division and that addition comes before subtraction is a common misunderstanding of how to interpret PEMDAS, and it's the main reason why so many of us who teach math hate that mnemonic.)

Therefore...

>6/2•(2+1) =
>
>6/2•(3) =
>
>3•(3) =
>
>9.

But for *implicit* multiplication there are two different approaches.

>**Notation I**
>
>Implicit multiplication has the same precedence as explicit multiplication.

So...

>6/2(2+1) =
>
>6/2(3) =
>
>3(3) =
>
>9.

That's the same answer that we got using explicit multiplication which makes sense since we treat both forms of multiplication identically.

>**Notation II**
>
>Implicit multiplication, unlike explicit multiplication, has precedence over division.

Under this order, we have to perform the implicit multiplication *before* we divide.

So...

>6/2(2+1) =
>
>6/2(3) =
>
>6/6 =
>
>1.

And this is different than the answer we got using explicit multiplication!

Another way to think of this is that multiplication by juxtaposition is treated as if the juxtaposed objects were grouped together.

This is similar to the way that we treat implicit addition. Mixed numbers, which consist of a whole number juxtaposed with a fraction, are treated as single items because they are *implicitly grouped*. So even though 4⅔ = 4 + ⅔, it isn't true that 

>3•4⅔ = 3•4 + ⅔, 

but rather that 

>3•4⅔ = 3•(4 + ⅔).

Applying this approach to implicit multiplication, we have

>6/2(2+1) =
>
>6/[ 2•(2+1) ] =
>
>6/[ 2•(3) ] =
>
>6/6 =
>
>1

which produces the same result as directly giving implicit multiplication precedence over division.

Neither notation is ""right"" or ""wrong."" Each has some advantages and disadvantages, so there are particular contexts where each of them is more common.

-----
**Calculators**

Calculator companies take different approaches.

For example, TI calculators use what I called Notation I, but Casio calculators use Notation II.

So on a TI

>6/2*(2+1) = 9

and 

>6/2(2+1) = 9,

but on a Casio

>6÷2×(2+1) = 9

while 

>6÷2(2+1) = 1.

If you read through the calculator manuals you'll see that they tell you which order of operations they are using. That way you can use the notation that matches your intent.

[Mathway](https://www.mathway.com), like Casio calculators, uses Notation II.

[Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) avoids the issue entirely by disallowing the use of ÷ or / and thus only allowing division to be represented through fraction bars. Because fraction bars implicitly group their entire numerators and denominators, the ambiguities don't arise.

-----
**Texbooks**

Older textbooks might use either convention, but modern textbooks usually avoid the issue by using fraction bars to indicate division (rather than the horizontal division symbols of ÷ or /) any time that the order of implicit multiplication would cause confusion.

That wasn't always a practical solution back when typesetting fractions was difficult and expensive, but computers have changed that.

-----
**Spreadsheets and Programming Languages**

These always require explicit multiplication. By not allowing implicit multiplication at all, they sidestep this potential ambiguity.

-----
**Math Memes**

The memes like the one you are confused about use implicit multiplication in such a way that the two conventions will produce different results, but the authors deliberately don't tell you which convention they intend for you to use.

And unless you know which rule you are supposed to apply in that context, the question ""What is the correct answer?"" isn't meaningful.

-----
**Side Note:** There are other conventions that can come into play here. For example, in the past the obelus, ÷, and the solidus, /, were sometimes considered to implicitly group symbols in ways that will have the same effect as Notation II in some instances. But I've ignored those alternate notations since they have largely fallen out of practice."
Why do people think 6 divided by 2(1 + 2) = 9,"6 divided by 2(1+2) means starting with 6 divide that first by 2 and multiply the result by (1+2) which gives 9 in total.

Linear Algebra would be typically taught to college students entering Math, Physics or engineering usually in their freshman year. This would be for 18 year olds who already finished introductory calculus. There is almost no way to go from basic Algebra to Linear Algebra in one step. Linear Algebra is far more abstract and difficult requiring considerable mathematical maturity.

Linear algebra is typically taught to students who have already learned calculus, and often taught with a higher level of abstraction, since it's a good time to push students who have learned calculus to increase their tolerance for abstraction - or so the thinking goes. But linear algebra has little to no reliance on calculus, so there's no reason one couldn't teach these concepts to someone with your experience, as long as the teaching methods are adapted a little.

Dynamical systems, gradient descent, and probability distributions are more advanced topics, for which one would like a student to also have knowledge of multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and some more advanced mathematics to develop the theory properly. But I could just about imagine how one could show some basic examples and give some conceptual understanding to a student who doesn't know calculus, at the expense of not being able to explain why certain things are true and only being able to demonstrate them empirically. It's not what a pure math course would do, certainly. But I could imagine this list of topics in a course intended to cover some very specific applications with the absolute minimum amount of mathematical theory behind them, and some universities offer such courses for students in specific programs of study.

Factoring polynomials will be an essential skill from the early stages of this course, because factoring a certain polynomial is the way you find the eigenvalues of a matrix, and finding eigenvalues has many important uses. If you want to be more ready, I would recommend making sure you understand the quadratic formula, the rational root theorem, and how to factor quadratics over the complex field when there are no real roots. But if this really is a designed sequence of courses, it should hopefully be made with your previous course in mind, so if you didn't learn those things already, you presumably will be shown them in the future.

The devil is, of course, in the details. Instead of asking us, I recommend you track down a professor who teaches or has recently taught the course you plan to take and see if they will briefly discuss with you what will be covered and what their expectations for you are."

You can always prove the rules you're trying to use. Here is the fraction one you mentioned."
The why of math rules.,"Some mathematical truths emerge as the properties of a system. Many others (often edge cases) are just decided by consensus.

Why is 1 not a prime number? Because the set of primes without 1 is far more useful than the set with 1 in it. If 1 was a prime number then we would have to define another set without 1.

Why is 0!=1? Well we could define 0!=0 but then we would have to define another operator that had the same behaviour but evaluated to 1 because we use that a lot.

Why does multiplication have precedence over addition in the order of operations? There's no reason why you couldn't have a+b×c=ab+ac but we don't and consistency in communication is really useful. Also, I don't know if it is because I grew up with one order or operations but that equation makes me twitch.

Now, each of these (and many more) you can argue that it is logical and reasonable that we define them the way we do but no matter how logical, it was a human decision to define them that way.

There could be a good book in this, ""a history of accepted mathematical truths"". How these decisions came to be made what was done before and if there are some groups that still do things differently. The book may even exist but, if it does, I have not come across it.

As regards multiplying by the reciprocal, it is an interesting one. I'd recommend looking at what division means. Take a simple example and phrase it differently:

I have 12 sweets and divide them equally amongst my 4 friends. They get 3 sweets each.

I have 12 sweets and give 1/4 of them to each of my 4 friends. They get 3 sweets each.

It's an interesting reworking of the same problem. The first is division, the second multiplication by a reciprocal. Does that mean that they are the same thing? 

I think your attitude of questioning curiosity does you credit. Unfortunately it will sometimes run up against the wall of ""we just decided it to do it that way"". When it does, I would recommend you look at what other ways it could have been done and why one might have been chosen over the others. That way ""we just do it like that"" becomes a jumping of point for more research rather than a dead end.

Good luck."
The why of math rules.,"> taking fractions that are being divided and multiplying by the reciprocal

This flows pretty directly from the definition of division. The number 1/a is whatever causes a(1/a) = 1 to be true.

If you have 1/(a/b), you can multiply the top and bottom by (b/a) without changing its value, since (b/a)/(b/a) = 1. So:

1/(a/b) = (b/a)/[(a/b)(b/a)] = (b/a)/1 = b/a"
The why of math rules.,Reminds me of asking why  the sin of 30 degrees is 0.5.
The why of math rules.,"So at a certain point math breaks down into definitions and axioms. If you learn what a rational number is and what multiplication is you can logically conclude what the multiplication between two rational numbers. Define, an inverse and then division of rational numbers makes sense."
The why of math rules.,"Every rule can ultimately be derived from the set of axioms in which you are working. Often the proofs are too complicated or not relevant to the application so they are simply given or provided with a hand wavey proof. Don't stress it too much, understanding often comes later."
The why of math rules.,"Math consists of a set of axioms that are used to derive other things.

For example

* x + 0 = x
* x * 1 = x
* x + y = y + x

These are assumed to be true. Like, that's it, there's no ""but does adding zero really not change anything?"" 

All of the other math shortcuts you've learned can be proved to be true by using a combination of these rules (and whatever other rules that have been proven to be true as well)

A formal proof for limits looks something like this

https://math.libretexts.org/Courses/Monroe_Community_College/MTH_210_Calculus_I_(Professor_Dean)/Chapter_2_Limits/2.7%3A_The_Precise_Definition_of_a_Limit

And once a proof of some concept is done, you can use it as a shortcut for everything else cause you don't need to write all that out whenever you want to use it.

I just accept the shortcuts for what they are, as understanding the formal proof doesn't really give me any more insight into what's going on."
The why of math rules.,"I like to tell my students “you don’t need to know how an engine works to drive a car” when you learn how to drive most folks won’t ask “but why does the car go when I press the gas pedal?!” Opening the hood and learning the inner workings is difficult and takes a lot more work than learning to drive. Some people will go on to learn about engines and that has its benefits but it’s not required and most are happy in their mechanical ignorance. Math is the same way. If you want to open the hood and go down that rabbit hole it can only benefit you but it can be quite the challenge. If you just do it “because the teacher said to” I think that’s fine too. Not everyone is going to be a mathematician. Not everyone is going to be a mechanic.

Edit: to-too"
The why of math rules.,"Multiplication is basically just “of” or “groups of”. 

Think about one, or 1/1, and multiply it by 1/2. Or, in other words, 1 group of one half (or a half group of one). This illustrates it a little better. Dividing is exactly opposite of that 

So, 1/1 divided by 1/2 is 2 because it’s like, doing the reverse of taking one half group of one, which is multiplying by 2. 

I wish I had a better way of explaining the division, but to me it’s just the exact opposite of multiplication. You’re taking the final product of multiplication and splitting it back up.

Idk that was probably incoherent I’m sorry"
The why of math rules.,"You are asking reasonable questions, but keep two things in mind:


1. Many mathematicians and math educators don't know much about the history of math aside from a few highlights, because much of it isn't all that relevant to actually learning or using math. That's not to say there is no value (there can be immense value), but it's not really been taught that way for long enough that most of the people you are asking truly don't know, and neither did the people who taught them, and so forth. 


2. The ""why"" explanations you are looking for are often several levels more advanced then the ""how"" explanations you are given. When I taught Calc, I tried to provide proofs where possible. But often the proof is not going to make any sense to the person learning because you would need to have mastered several more classes first. 


That's not to say you shouldn't ask questions like this; you should! But just realized that it's not just bad teachers who don't know or don't want to tell you. Even if *they* know, the explanation you are asking for may be incomprehensible to you at the point in time in which you are asking for it, and would not benefit you in the slightest."
The why of math rules.,"The thing is that a lot of ""answers"" about how things work in pure math are emergent, not defined. This is a very difficult thing to explain at lower levels of mathematics because it's abstract and only makes sense after you've seen it happen several times, which requires working at a higher level.

To understand what I mean, watch [this bit of this video](https://youtu.be/lFlu60qs7_4?t=1038) (watch the entire thing for context). Prof. Kontorovich explains why starting math with definitions doesn't work, and instead you should start math using undefined terms. It sounds very strange, but what he's saying is that you can give names to things that happen, but suspend judgment on *what those things are*, because if you don't, you'll likely form wrong ideas.

In this video, they're talking about how Euclid defined what a straight line is and then went off proving a bunch of stuff, but it turns out he was just wrong about what a straight line is. It turns out that if you draw a straight line in a curved space, like on the surface of a sphere, it doesn't do a lot of things that your wrong idea of a straight line should do.

It turns out that these concepts are often more general than we appreciate. We see a thing like a ""straight line"" in one specific context and we say, oh, this is easy, I know what a straight line is now, and you write it down. But when you write it down, you aren't writing down the intrinsic properties of a straight line, you're writing down *some* intrinsic (that is, inherent to the thing itself, regardless of context) properties and *some* extrinsic (that is, conferred upon the thing by the context it's currently in) properties. So you haven't understood what a straight line is at all, you've only understood it in this one context. And, even worse, you're not even sure if that thing is completely general even within that fixed context…as you move it around within that context, you might run into issues.

What you want is to know the definitions of everything up front, like Euclid wanted in that video. What we've learned since then is to hang a term on a thing and the move it around to all the different places that thing can exist, and see what emerges as the intrinsic properties of the thing.

Having said all that … when it comes to dividing fractions with fractions, the way to think about this is as follows. Say you have 2 cups of milk and you're going to put that into a quart (4 cups) container. How much of the container will that fill? 2/4 is half a container.

What if you have half a cup of milk instead? That's ½/4, or you could think of it as ½ × ¼ = ⅛ a container.

What if you have half a cup of milk and you're putting it into ¼ cup containers? How many do you need? Well, that's ½/¼ = 4 × ½ = 2 containers.

What if you have a half a cup of milk and you're putting it in ⅓ cup containers? That's ½/⅓ = 3 × ½ = 1½ containers.

What if you have three quarter cup of milk and you're putting it in two-third cup containers? How many containers do you need now?

You get the idea."
The why of math rules.,I believe that you aren't reading your textbook. Every chapter starts with an explanation of why you can do the topic of the chapter.
The why of math rules.,">One example I remember being an issue in school and when I started up again was taking fractions that are being divided and multiplying by the reciprocal.

Division is just the inverse of multiplication. Every real number x ≠ 0 has a multiplcative inverse y such that xy = 1. Some algebra shows that y = 1/x = x^(-1). Notice that technically x is a fraction, x/1, so x^(-1) is simply the reciprocal of x. This also holds if the denominator is not 1. If x = p/q, where p and q are not zero, then x^(-1) = q/p since (p/q)(q/p) = (pq)/(qp) = 1. 

Dividing by value is equivalent to multiplying by the inverse of that value, y/x = yx^(-1), and the inverse of a value is its reciprocal. This is why we can to from dividing by a fraction to multiplying by the reciprocal of that fraction. 

You could probably get a good bit of the context you're curious about by simply browsing the Wikipedia articles for relevant concepts. The articles on the history of mathematics might be interesting as well."
The why of math rules.,"The why would be covered by books like Baby Rudin, which are very very difficult for someone at your level to understand.  Don't expect any answer without question, but sometimes the answer is deeper than you might be ready for.  Maybe you could understand and practice the first chapter and it would be a good challenge."
The why of math rules.,"I've been there. I struggled with math as a kid, and just recently have realized I'm actually good at it. I'd ask the same questions. But I finally learned that the why isn't always helpful, because it can be so complex.

Math people can start talking and because they already understand what they are talking about, they often don't realize that it's just getting more confusing the more detail they give to us normal people. 😉

Math is a language describing concepts and giving an abstract representation of something real. It's like using the word ""love"" to describe how you feel about someone. Obviously, we can go into the history of why we use the word love and the linguistics, but that doesn't help us understand the meaning. But once we have experienced love and relate the word to the experience, any time that word is used, we instantly understand what it means.

Math is the same way, but it's more difficult than language in some ways because language relates to words we already grasp the meaning of. Math describes concepts we need to understand; so we are learning a language and an idea at the same time. That's difficult to do. Add in anxiety and time pressure, and you have a lot of people give up and think they must be stupid.

Hopefully that clarified something....."
The why of math rules.,"Surely as a young child you were given the example displaying fractions by cutting a whole pie into slices? Cut the whole pie into two equal sized pieces and you take one of the pieces, then you have taken 1 out of the 2 pieces (which is a half or 1/2) ? Usually this is example is given to 6-7 year olds lol"
The why of math rules.,"The reason usually boils down to ""this is a notationally convenient way to organize or simplify an idea that will solve this problem"".  There's hardly ever some fundamental why that beats that. 

In the case of simplifying equations, it isn't like you *have* to multiply by reciprocals. You can always just do successive multiplication and division steps until you get bored and start trying to do them all in one step - once you do that, you've invented the same process you were skipping."
The why of math rules.,">fractions that are being divided and multiplying by the reciprocal

There are a few ways to approach this. I'll give a bit of handwavey explanation to try to give you some intution for it.

* The fraction ""x/y"" is the number you get when you ""divide x by y"".
* But we could also write this as ""x \* 1/y"".
* Well, this *is* multiplying by the reciprocal! I took the numerator, and then multiplied it by the reciprocal of the denominator. i.e. ""y"" was on the bottom of the fraction, and I can take out that ""/y"" and instead multiply by the ""reciprocal of y"" (1/y).
* And this keeps working even if ""x"" an ""y"" happen to be fractions themselves! So this remains a valid method even if we're working with fractions."
The why of math rules.,"I know that you marked this resolved, but I want to try an approach to answering your excellent question. Ignore this if it seems either redundant or unhelpfully abstradt. But first

> When being told to do something I ask why and get the response of ""It's just how it works"" or ""It's the rule of whatever"". Those answers don't help me.

You are thinking like a mathematician! You are asking the right questions, and you are right to be unsatified with the answers. But to also have sympathy with the people who are giving you those unsatificatory answers, it is hard to actually explain _why_ the rule system has been designed the way it is without going into some fairly esoteric abstractions.

I am going to try to do so, at least to some degree of abstraction. First of all, people were doing arithmatic long before the stuff I will take about was formally defined. But over the past couple of hundred years, there has been a move to ask ""what do we need for arithmatic to work"". In some sense, it has only been relatively recently that mathematicians have been asking the kinds of questions that you have been asking (even though they did know why the recipricol rule works).

## What do we want of arithmatic and numbers?

There are a bunch of things we want to be true of the particular number system that we are all taught in school. (Yes, there are other systems, but I am going to talk only about the system we were all taught in school.)

For example we want addition of positive numbers to make things bigger. I am going to write that algebriacally as, ""if _a_ is any number and  _b_ is a positive number, then a + b should be larger than _a_."" And I could write that more using more symbols as, ""for all numbers _a_ and all numbers _b_ such that _b_ > 0, _a_ + _b_ > _a_."" There is other notation that would make that more concise, but these are just different ways of saying that one of the things we want to arithmatic is for addition of positive numbers to make things bigger.

Now I am going to totally ignore that particular property in what follows. I just wanted to give it as an example of what I mean by ""things we want to arithmatic and numbers"".

Here are a few more things.

- If we add two numbers together we want the result to also be a number. That is, if _a_ and _b_ are any numbers than _a_ + _b_ is also a number.
- If we multiply two numbers together we want the result to also be a number. That is, if _a_ and _b_ are any numbers than _a_ × _b_ is also a number.
- We want the result of addition to be the same in any order. That is for any numberfs _a_ and _b_ we want _a_ + _b_ = _b_ + _a_
- - We want the result of multiplication to be the same in any order. That is for any numberfs _a_ and _b_ we want _a_ × _b_ = _b_ × _a_.

Those seems pretty obvious properties we want of arithmatic once they are explicitly stated. And there is special terminology for those that I will skip. There are a couple more properties that are a bit more abstract, and not something that one would obviously want, but there are reasons that I will get to shortly.

- There is a number like 0 such that anything added to 0 is itself. That is for all numbers _a_, _a_ + 0 = _a_.
- There is a number like 1 such that anything multiplied by 1 is itself. That is, for all numbers _a_, _a_ × 1 = _a_.


There are special names for the 0 number and the 1 number, but I will just use ""0"" and ""1"". 

0 and 1 are important because this gets to be able to state another couple of properties we want.

- For any number _a_ there is another number we will call -_a_ such that _a_ + -_a_ = 0. You have learned that -_a_ is the ""negative"" of _a_. Here I am going to introduce the fancy terminology of calling it the ""additive inverse"" of _a_.

- For any number _a_ other than 0 there is a ""multipicative inverse"" that we will call 1/a such that a × 1/a = 1.

The first of those two allows us to define substraction and negative numbers. The second allows us to define division and fractional amounts. If we hadn't added those two properites about there being additive and multiplicative inverses our arithmatic and number system would be limited to whole numbers (including zero).

Notationally ""b/a"" is just a shortcut for writing ""b × 1/a"".

I need to finish this in the next minute or so, so I will just say that others have shown you the algebraic manipulations that get this whole things about division and recipricols. And what I am asserting is that something like reciprocols need to exist in order to have division and fractional amounts. I haven't argued why that is the case, but I hope I have given some sense of the fact that the definitions and ""rules"" that you have been presented with were design to make things like division and multiplication and numbers to actually work the way that we expect."
The why of math rules.,"The trick you refer, only works with rational numbers (or reals, or complex). For example, in integers, you can't do that. So 7/2 isn't 7 \* (1/2), since (1/2) isn't an integer. If you restrict yourself to the integers, 7/2 doesn't have a solution.

Basically, the sanest choice is to start with a number set (the integers, the rationals, the reals), and then add an operation to it, and see what happens.

What you're describing as the inverse of a fraction is a natural result of the set of rationals (or reals), with addition and multiplication, and defining division as multiplication by the inverse. So a / b means multiply a by the inverse of b. Then everything flows from that definition. It doesn't work if you restrict the set of operations to only the whole numbers, since only 1 and -1 have inverses in those cases."
The why of math rules.,"look up the history of calculus and the history of limits.

A brier summary:

Calculus was created because they needed a way to solve problems in an easier way. This used Infinitesimals to get very close to zero while avoiding division by zero.

Limits were created because people did not like Infinitesimals, so they made something that works similarly but different from those"

I need help.,"You're at a point where there isn't that much to catch up on. In theory, it could be a few weeks of dedication at most to get you up to speed.

My advice would be to put definitions of common mathematics rules that they would teach you into cue cards. I would use the application anki on your computer, with the FSRS scheduler if you aren't trying to cram too quickly. It will tell you when you should take a break from studying.

For example, a card

    FRONT:
    Exponent rules
    BACK:
    Product rule: x^a * x^b = x^(a+b)
    Quotient rule: x^a / x^b = x^(a-b)
    ...

Combine this with general rules for learning. I wish they would have gone over this for me while I was in highschool, it will save you many hours when it comes to learning.

\- **Active recall** is always better than reading information over and over. Do tasks that force you to recall information (like using cue cards!) instead of studying by reading over and over

\- **Interleave** new and old information. That means shuffling the cue cards or doing problems from different concepts.

\- **Sleep** well after you study. After sleeping, you will perform significantly better at any task you were studying to perform at. Sleep is where your hard work turns into performance gains. Experts sleep MORE on days that they practice, not less.

\- **Elaborate** on what you're learning, when you look at a concept you should try to think about how this fits into the bigger picture. This might be more applicable to you when you get to harder topics

\- **Space out learning.** Everyone learns more efficiently by spacing, if you have 4 hours to study and choose to split this up into 1 hour blocks (preferably across multiple days), you will learn significantly more than if you study for 4 hours straight."
[Hyp/Diff Geo] Proving circles map to circles in the half-plane model,"You're right that f(aC) = (1/a) f(C), and aC just means the set { a c | c in C}. Before we dive into the statement that we can rotate, note that the lemma talks about a circle C *in the plane*, i.e. in the complex plane, not in the hyperbolic plane/upper half space. Then we can rotate C by multiplying all its points with some complex number exp(t i), where t is the angle with which we want to rotate. Putting a = exp(t i). the fact that f (aC) = (1/a) f(C) means that f(C) is a circle iff f(aC) is. Hence it suffices to show that f(aC) is a circle, and since we are free to pick the angle of rotation, we might just rotate to get to the situation where the center of C lies on the real axis. Then we can carry out the remainder of the argument."

How is x^x^x different to (x^x)^x?,"Raising to a power is not associative, meaning that if you remove the brackets that the expression becomes ambiguous.

It's easy to see that with an example:

3\^(3\^3) = 3\^27 = 7.6 x 10\^12

(3\^3)\^3 = 27\^3 = 19683

If people don't write the brackets, they tend to mean the first expression. Ie, a ""power tower"" like a\^a\^a\^a usually means to start from the top of the tower and work your way down: a\^(a\^(a\^a))). But strictly speaking an expression with repeated powers doesn't parse without brackets."
How is x^x^x different to (x^x)^x?,"x\^x\^x actually means x\^(x\^x), not (x\^x)\^x.

Just like x-x-x actually means (x-x)-x, not x-(x-x).

Subtraction is left-associative. Exponentiation is right-associative. That's just the convention.

The reason behind the convention is just what you noticed, (a\^b)\^c would be better written as a\^(bc). But there's no better way to write a\^(b\^c), so we might as well make that nice to write by not requiring the parentheses."
How is x^x^x different to (x^x)^x?,"It is not -- ""x\^x\^x"" is ambiguous, since it depends on whether we consider exponentiation left- or [right-associative][1]. Use parentheses to avoid that problem.

Why isn’t infinity times zero -1?,"well, it's an interesting take."
Why isn’t infinity times zero -1?,"Infinity is not a numerical value. 

A vertical line does NOT have a slope of infinity. It's slope is 'undefined'."
Why isn’t infinity times zero -1?,"I respect the uniqueness of this take. Everyone else has explained why not better than I could. But I'll add a counter question for better understanding: if the slope of a vertical line is infinity, what does a line with a slope of negative infinity look like?"
Why isn’t infinity times zero -1?,"The product of the slopes of two lines that are reflected across the line y = x are 1.  y=0 and x=0 are reflections of each other, so shouldn't infinity \* zero = 1?"
Why isn’t infinity times zero -1?,"This is a really good take! One thing to realize, though, is that we can make a line get closer and closer to vertical by tilting it in two different ways: by taking the slope to infinity, or by taking it to negative infinity. It might be more proper to say that the slope of a vertical line is +-infinity rather than just infinity.

I would say that defining infinity times zero to be a real number has all the usual problems people point out, **but** the insight you are having is a real and important one, which is borne out in some mathematical structures people use that are related to slopes in some way. I suggest looking into the Riemann sphere and Möbius transformations, the real projective space RP^1, and the one-point compactification of the real line (which is a circle)."
Why isn’t infinity times zero -1?,"Interesting, let m_1 and m_2 be the gradients of two perpendicular lines intersecting at some fixed point ( wlog the origin). now let this set of lines rotate around the point by the same angle. lets say the angle of line 1 to the positive x axis is \theta .

Then to make your observation precise, we take a limit of the product of the gradients as theta approaches 0. this limit will be -1 as you mentioned. and you could go through an algebraic calculation of the limit and arrive at -1 too im sure.
(I think better to just imagine the cross made by the 2 intersecting perpendicular lines rotating together about a point)

but as others have said ininity * 0 is indeterminate, and limits of this form, such as the one we encounter here as the product of 2 slopes, can turn out to equal any real number you would like. it was just -1 in this specific case. thats the important thing to remember about limits like this, and any indeterminate form. its indetermninate because these limits can take various values depending on what specific function you are taking the limit of."
Why isn’t infinity times zero -1?,"I'd like to give a different answer than the ones other people gave. Because I think there is interesting maths in your questions that requires us to leave the reals behind.

First off I'd say the obvious way to think about the slope of a vertical line is going to the projective reals. It's a number space that extends the reals by an element ω which has the properties a/ω = 0 and a/0 = ω. The projective reals are all about perspective and geometry, one way of phrasing the second one is imagineing a line with slope 0 relative to the x axis that intersects the y axis at a, the expression then says it meets the x axis at ω, or colloqially ""parallel lines meet at infinity"". Note that the notion of slope is a bit different here, but for our purposes it doesn't matter, Google projective reals if you're interested and look for a graphic with a circle and lines.

The other property of ω is exactly what you're saying - a vertical (infinity slope) line meets the x axis at 0.

So what is 0 * ω in the projective reals? Well if we juggle around the top identities we see that a = ω * 0 for all a! So ω * 0 is actually undefined, even in this space. Another way of thinking about it is that ω doesn't have a sign, because parallel lines meet at both positive and negative infinity."
Why isn’t infinity times zero -1?,"The problem is that infinity times zero can be interpreted in a lot of different ways.

For example the limit for x going to infinity of (1/x \* x) is 1, so in that case it'd be convenient if we defined the product of zero times infinity to be 1.

But of course this works with any number, that's why we say it's undefined."
Why isn’t infinity times zero -1?,"> Since they are perpendicular to each other, shouldn't the product of the slopes be negative one?

The rule `m_1 × m_2 = −1` only holds when both gradients exist and are non-zero real numbers. Neither gradient can be zero, since there is no number that when multiplied by 0 gives −1. A vertical line has an undefined gradient. Informally, it is both +∞ and −∞ at the same time."
Why isn’t infinity times zero -1?,Terrance Howard?
Why isn’t infinity times zero -1?,"In your logic it's +infinity \* -0, or -infinity \* +0.

Imagine your perpendicular lines.  Now you're rotating so that one of the lines goes vertical.  Up until the point where it's exactly vertical, you'll have a slope of x and -1/x and the product will be -1.  If x is approaching 0 from the + or - direction the -1/x is going to diverge to either -infinity or +infinity.  But either way the product of the slopes never changes away from -1.

At the exact point where one line is vertical, the answer is undefined.  But the *limit* remains negative 1.  It's a good insight, and when you move to calculus and beyond you'll find ways to make this rigorous.

But this answer is entirely problem-dependent!  You can easily have another problem where instead of x \* -1/x you'll have some other product and get a different answer.  In calculus this is called an indeterminate form.  It all depends on how fast the one term goes to infinity versus how fast the other term goes to zero.

If you work in the extended reals you can use +infinity and -infinity as numbers.  There is of course only one zero...though on some computer floating-point systems there can be a +0 and -0 that mostly behave the same, and in limits approaching from the + or - directions can sometimes behave differently.  But there's never any consistent way to define infinity times zero without giving up some other even more useful property of arithmetic."
Why isn’t infinity times zero -1?,infinity times zero can be anything its same as 0/0 which can be anything if you manipulate it enough
Why isn’t infinity times zero -1?,"Because the condition for orthogonal lines isn't really that the product of the gradients is 0.
In general Euclidean space (any number of dimensions, not just 2), a straight line can be described using two vectors: a point on the line /a/ and a direction vector /b/, so that each point on the line is of the form /a+λb/ for some value of the parameter λ.
Orthogonality comes from the direction vectors being orthogonal, which is equivalent to the dot product being 0 - in 2 dimensions a general direction vector is b=(α,β) and the slope of this line (when α is not zero) is β/α. The dot product in 2 dimensions is (α,β).(γ,δ)=αγ+βδ, so to make this zero we set the second direction vector to be (a multiple of) (-β,α) - this the gradient of this line is -α/β and the product is -1. What I'm trying to say is that the product being -1 is just a consequence of us being in 2D (so that we can even define a gradient) and having α,β nonzero (so that the slopes are defined) - we shouldn't expect this to carry over to the case where b=(0,1) because then clearly the second direction vector should instead be (some multiple of) (1,0); we have to get both parts of the dot product to vanish, instead of cancel out, so instead of - signs we need 0's"

(-x)•1/x=-1. If you take the limit for x->infinity or x->0 of the previous expression, you get -1 being the quantity constant for every x.

But infinity it’s not a number in analysis (except in nonstandard analysis which I know nothing about), you can only access infinity through limits.

In this construction, then the product N * (-1/N) does equal -1.


But... Let y = -1/k x where k is 2N. This line has the SAME standardization, y = 0 but the product is - N /(2N) = -1/2


The difference in angle between them is infinitesimal but the product of the slopes differs by a factor of 2."

Why isn’t infinity times zero -1?,"A bunch of other people are saying ""infinity isn't a number, it's a concept"". This is a stupid take. All numbers are concepts.

**You are, actually, correct! Sort of.**

Infinity is not a number *in the real number system, ℝ*. But we can extend ℝ to the [*projective reals*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_line): a number system that also has a number called 'infinity', written ∞. This number actually stands for *both* what you would normally think of as ""+∞"" and ""-∞"".

In this system, 1/0 is ∞, and 1/∞ is 0.

0\*∞ is not defined in this system. *However*, we can rewrite the rule for perpendicular slopes to be ""s₁ and s₂ are perpendicular if s₂ = -1/s₁"". And now, this works perfectly - even with lines with slope 0 and ∞, the same equation works!

We don't typically work in the projective reals: introducing ∞ as a number means we have to check for undefined results whenever we *multiply*, not just divide. So it's easier to stick with ℝ most of the time, and not have to worry about it. But in some contexts, it's nice to use!"
Why isn’t infinity times zero -1?,Thing is. Integral calculus is basically all Infinity times zero problems that all have different answers.
Why isn’t infinity times zero -1?,"As always for these questions: some standard axioms from arithmetic will always be violated if we included infinity, making it a bad decision in general.

In fact, the defining property of 0 is that it's an additive identity, and in a ring (where you can add and multiply, with standard axioms) you must have that 0*x = 0 for any x."
Why isn’t infinity times zero -1?,"Close: the vertical line has a slope of -infinity (not +infinity). And (-infinity)\*(+0) = -1 in this context. Consider the pair of perpendicular lines y=-mx and y=(+1/m)\*x, letting m go to +infinity. 

More precisely, depending on the approximation (the direction you're approaching it from), a vertical line could have a slope of +infinity OR it could have a slope of -infinity. By the same processes, a horizontal line could have a slope of -0 (-epsilon < 0) OR it could have a slope of +0 (+epsilon > 0). 

Unfortunately (as becomes clear in Calculus), the correct value of (0)\*(+/-infinity) is very sensitive to ""what you mean by zero"" and to ""what you mean by infinity"" -- both of these are determined by how successively-closer approximations are being chosen."

Why isn’t infinity times zero -1?,"Love this, especially since 1 is intuitively between 0 and infinity in a multiplicative sense, but I think as a teacher the “going further” question I’d ask back is “why -1 and not 1?” (Imagine the line with slope infinity is pointing down, not up)"
Why isn’t infinity times zero -1?,"Straight line y=a, slope m = 0.


Limit of (y2-y1)/(x2-x1) (slope of a line) as x2-x1 approaches zero is a/0 and thus approaches infinity.


Taking the reciprocal slope of y=a is -1/0, a very similar expression.
 
However, note that to build the equivalence you want (that 0xinf equals -1) requires us to do two things we aren't allowed to do - set an undefined limit of an expression equal to a non-limit expression and then cancel out a division by 0 (when we cancel out such division, it relies on the denominator not being 0). 


That said I'd be pretty convinced that the limit of the product of a slope and it's reciprocal equals -1 as the slope approaches 0 (ie Lim m(-1/m) = -1 as m approaches 0). 


As a counterexample why this is not always true, consider Lim m(5/m) which is also the limit of inf times 0 but the answer is 5, or Lim m(5/m^2 ) where the answer is 0. You can also make one where the limit is infinite still "

Why isn’t infinity times zero -1?,Vertical and horizontal lines don’t have slopes.
Why isn’t infinity times zero -1?,">Since they are perpendicular to each other, shouldn't the product of the slopes be negative one?

Our canonical definition of two vectors a and b being ""orthogonal"" when you have a scalar product • is a•b=0; since a vertical line is defined by the vector (0,1) and an horizontal by the vector (1,0), you have that in fact their scalar product is 0*1+1*0=0.

The real problem is that ±∞ are not real numbers and adding them to ℝ can make it behave quite badly from an algebraic point of view. Let's try it! I'll set some ""reasonable"" expectations for how ±∞ should behave algebraically, and see if they get us to some ""evil"" conclusion.

1. (+∞)+(-∞) = 0, to respect how opposites work in ℝ

2. ±∞ times a positive number is still ±∞, while multiplying by a negative number flips its sign

3. (+∞)+(+∞) = (+∞)×(+∞) = +∞ (we will call this properties ""additive/multiplicative idempotency"")

Now, let's assume (+∞)×0 = X for some real number X. Since we want to preserve the algebraic properties of ℝ, we can use distributivity to write

X = (+∞)×0 = (+∞)×(1-1) = (+∞)+(-∞) = 0

So we concluded X=0, but we can also use associativity to write

X = [(+∞)+(+∞)]+(-∞) = (+∞)+[(+∞)+(-∞)] = (+∞)+0 = +∞

So we conclude that +∞=0, quite an interesting fact, isn't it?

Now, the real problem lies in the third property, idempotency: speaking in mathematical jargon, ℝ with its sum is something called a ""group"", a set where you have an associative operation which has a (unique) neutral element and in which all elements have an inverse. There is a theorem which states

>The only idempotent element in a group is its neutral element

Now, ℝ with its sum is a group with 0 as its neutral element, but we have also a group when considering ℝ without 0 with its product and 1 as the neutral element. Since we reasonably require +∞ to be idempotent both additively and multiplicatively, applying the theorem above we obtain

1 = +∞ = 0

Which is nonsensical! Now, we ***could*** add ±∞ to ℝ while preserving idempotency, but we would have to sacrifice other properties, mainly the associative one and take it from a mathematician with a passion for category theory, you ***don't*** want to live in a world without the associative property.

EDIT: In fact, when doing geometry or topology, we add infinity to ℝ all the time, and in many different (but some equivalent) ways! The real projective line, the Riemann sphere, the Alexandroff compactification and many other examples."

That's not exactly the same thing though, since you could take any possible number and  come up with a product of two parts, one of which goes to Infinity and the other to zero, whose limit is that number. "
Why isn’t infinity times zero -1?,"Smart take! The issue is that the orthogonality condition only holds for finite values of the slopes (e.g. f(x) = –2x + 1, g(x) = 0.5x + 3, then we have that _f_ and _g_ are perpendicular lines since (–2)×(0.5) = –1). The reason is that a vertical line has +infinity _and_ –infinity as slope, since you can't really distinguish between them.

Why isn’t infinity times zero -1?,"Because there are “different” infinities and “different” zeroes.

On the other hand, if you were to try and calculate infinity times zero as the limit of x*(1/x^2 ) when x tends to infinity, you would instead find the result to be zero."
Why isn’t infinity times zero -1?,Infinity isn’t a number
Why isn’t infinity times zero -1?,"That’s a great question! Here's a way to think about it more clearly.

The slope of a line is determined by dividing the change in y by the change in x. This tells us how much y increases or decreases for each unit x changes. For a vertical line, the change in x is always zero, which leads to division by zero. Since division by zero is not allowed in mathematics, the slope of a vertical line is undefined.

The rule about perpendicular slopes multiplying to −1 only works when both slopes are actual numbers. A horizontal line has a slope of zero, but since the vertical line doesn't have a real slope, we can't apply the rule. That’s why we can’t say infinity times zero equals −1."

For example, you’re describing the product of the slope of a line m and its perpendicular -1/m as m approaches 0. 

What if you substitute m for 2m for the first line? The product would be -2 instead of -1.  When m = 0, you would still be multiplying 0 and infinity. But now you’ve proved that = -2

You could do this for any value. That’s why it is undefined. 

You could say it approaches this as a “limit” as m approaches 0, but that is not the same and can even be different depending on which way you approach 0 (eg a hyperbole might have different signs on either side of an asymptote).

Why isn’t infinity times zero -1?,"So thing is a slope of infinity is not a vertical line.

That’s because a vertical line at x=0 does not have a defined point at x=1, whereas if my function was:

y=x*infinity

Then I would have an answer for y at any x. It would be infinity multiplied by y. There is also only one value of y for every value of x, which is not the case for the truly vertical line.

You can construct some calculus equations: f(x) and g(x) such that as x → ∞ you have f(x) -> 0 and g(x) → ∞ but f(x)*g(x) can approach any value via L'Hôpital's rule.

Here's how:

For any a > 0, choose real numbers c and d, and define:

f(x) = c / x^a

g(x) = d * x^a


Then, as x → ∞:

lim (x → ∞) [ f(x) * g(x) ] = c / d

So by selecting different values for c and d, you can make the limit anything you want.

If c = π and d = 1, then the limit is π.

Help deriving tangent line equation??,"How much do you know about derivatives at this point?

I am going to assume you are somewhere in te process of discovering them, but the best answer depends on how far into that you are."
Help deriving tangent line equation??,"The derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = 3x^(2) - 1. This gives us the slope of a line tangent to f(x) at any value of x. For x = 2, this is f'(2) = 3(2)^(2) - 1 = 3(4) - 1 = 12 - 1 = 11. 

The value of f(2) is 2^(3) - 2 = 8 - 2 = 6. So now we have a slope and a point on the line, (2, 6). You could find the equation of the line, which is y = 11x - 16, and then try to get it in a form of one of the answers. This would be a little tedious.

Notice the forms in the answers don't have an explicit y-intercept. How would you get a line to pass through the origin? Well, you could shift one of the points down to the origin. For our line, this would give us (y - 6) = 11(x - 2)."

To answer your second question the common forms of a liner equation (in two variables) are:

**Standard Form**

Ax + By = C

No circling back. Once you know about derivitives, that provides you the slope at a specific point on a curve. So once we know the x coordinate (2), we can get the y cooridntate f(x) and use the derivative (f'(x)) to find the slope of the tangent line at that pont

Then we have a point on the tangent line *(2, f(2))*  and the slope *m = f'(2)*

y - f(2) = f'(2)(x - f(2))"

The equations are in point-slope form, one of the ways that one can write an equation of a line (typically learned in Algebra 1). I find that we use this form a lot when coming up with equations of tangent lines.

Given slope m and point (x1, y1), the point-slope form is\
y - y1 = m(x - x1).

In the context of calculus, the point is (c, f(c)) and the slope is f’(c), so the equation becomes this:\
y - f(c) = f’(c)(x - c).

In calculus books they will have a variant of the point-slope form where they isolate the y.\
y = f(c) + f’(c)(x - c).

I like this form because it’s the form for the linear approximation of a function, and it can be extended to polynomial approximations later when you learn infinite series."
I can't understand how Riemann sum translates to Integration/Antiderivative.,"You're looking for the ""Fundamental Theorem of Calculus"" (FTC) linking both concepts together. There is an amazingly intuitive introduction by [3b1b][1], explaining it better than I ever could here in textform.

[1]:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfG8ce4nNh0"
I can't understand how Riemann sum translates to Integration/Antiderivative.,"First we gotta clear up some terms. An integral, by definition, is the limit of Riemann sums. Area, by definition, is the integral (not the other way around). It is the FTC that connects integrals and antiderivatives. (""Indefinite integral"" is just a lazy way to refer to antiderivatives; ignore that term for this post; all integrals are definite.) Derivative is the limit of the difference quotient; ""slope"" is just a way to introduce the idea. 

Next, figure out what question you're asking. You say you don't understand area, but you do in the same sentence. Do you first need to ask about why Riemann sums give you area before we talk about the FTC? 

Also, are you asking for intuition or technical justification? Intuitively, that 3b1b video is the best there is. You need to get specific about what you don't understand. There isn't much to it besides the difference quotient of area involved the ""next"" Riemann rectangle. If you want technical, have you tried reading the proof? If not, then you haven't actually tried to understand. If yes, ask a question about it. Be specific about what you don't understand. It wouldn't be a famous theorem if it just magically made sense."
I can't understand how Riemann sum translates to Integration/Antiderivative.,"Try imagining a “discrete” version of the integral and derivative.

Say that F(x) = f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + … + f(x). Now, by what amount does F(x) change when you go from F(x-1) to F(x)? "
I can't understand how Riemann sum translates to Integration/Antiderivative.,"You stated that you understood Riemann sums. Consider the infimum of the upper sum and then supremum of the lower sum. What is this doing? 

This is how we define the upper/lower Riemann integrals. We define the upper Riemann integral as the infimum of upper sum and similarly for lower integral, the supremum of the lower sum. 

What happens when the widths of the rectangles (from the intervals within the partition) get infinitely small? (This is where we take the limit) 

If the upper and lower integrals of a function f are equal, then we say that f is Riemann integrable. 

Have you considered the function f mapping to the reals where f(x) = 1 If x is rational and f(x) = 0 if x is irrational? Have a little look into this and check to see if f is Riemann integrable and then it might make more sense."
I can't understand how Riemann sum translates to Integration/Antiderivative.,"Most commenters have already put forth reasonable explanations so I am only going to make a couple of comments to specifically point out things that you said which are just wrong.

> What I understand is definite integral is indefinite integral with one extra step.

No. This is a terrible way to understand integrals and you need to destroy it immediately. A definite integral gives signed area under a curve. The definite integral is defined as the relevant limit of Riemann sums. The indefinite integral is just a bad piece of notation which tells you to take antiderivatives.

> When we integrate the function to find the area under a curve or when we integrate a function in general, we are trying to find a a function whose slope at every point is represented by the function we are integrating over

Again not true, this is precisely the assertion of the fundamental theorem of calculus, which does not apply to every function. How would you reconcile this line of reasoning with integrating, say, a step function? You can't, because step functions don't change smoothly."
I can't understand how Riemann sum translates to Integration/Antiderivative.,"Imagine you have calculated the area under the curve f(t) between 0 and some number x and denote this area A(x). That is A(x)=int_(0)^(x)f(t)dt. What happens if you vary the upper bound x? By calculus you know this rate of change is given by the derivative of the integral written above.

Now we reason what this will be equal to geometrically. If you vary x by some small amount dx you are adding a very small amount to the area. We can approximate this by a rectangle of height f(x) and width dx. Now by the definition of a derivative

A'(x)=lim_(dx->0)(A(x+dx)-A(x))/dx

and since this small change in area is f(x)dx we have

A'(x)=lim_(dx->0)(f(x)dx)/dx=f(x)

i.e. the fundamental theorem of calculus. This is far from rigorous, but should give you a more intuitive understanding of why integrals are related to anti derivatives. In summary, the area under a function is changing by the current height of the function so an integral and derivative cancel out."
I can't understand how Riemann sum translates to Integration/Antiderivative.,">What the heck does slope got to do with area? What kinda sorcery is this?

This is the first part of the FTC. I'll walk through the full explanation, and you can let me know which part feels weird.

Let F(a,b) be the area underneath a function, f, from a to b. One way to define and calculate F(a,b) is by using the limit of Riemann sums. If we hold a constant, then F(a,x) is a function of x, and we can ask is F differentiable and if so what is dF/dx?

Simply plugging F into the difference quotient (with a bit of algebra and the mean value theorem) gives dF/dx=f(x).

Even though we don't yet have a simple formula for our area function, we do have a strict definition (Riemann sums), and we know it's derivative! So all that's left is to take the antiderivative of f(x) and we get an equation for F(a,x).

>How are both Riemann sum and the definite integral or equal?

This is part 2 of the FTC.

Notice that for a value, c, in the interval \[a,b\] we have F(b)-F(a)=\[F(b)-F(c)\]+\[F(c)-F(a)\]. The algebra here is just that the F(c)s cancel out, but geometrically it's like we are splitting the interval \[a,b\] into two pieces and adding them back together. There's nothing special about c here either, we could do this as many times as we want for any values in the interval:

F(b)-F(a)=\[F(b)-F(x1)\]+\[F(x1)-F(x2)\]+\[F(x2)-F(x3)\]+...\[F(xn)-F(a)\].

Applying the (derivative) mean value theorem to these terms yields:

F(b)-F(a)= F'(c1)(b-x1)+F'(c2)(x1-x2)+F'(c3)(x2-x3)+...F'(cn)(xn-a)

where c\_k is some value in the interval \[x\_(k-1),x\_k\]. Since F'(x)=f(x) as we saw above, we have

F(b)-F(a)= f(c1)(b-x1)+f(c2)(x1-x2)+f(c3)(x2-x3)+...f(cn)(xn-a).

But this is literally just a Riemann sum of f on the interval \[a,b\]! So the definite integral can be evaluated by F(b)-F(a).

I hope this helps! In both cases it is very useful to understand the various mean value theorems, so they may be worth reviewing if you aren't fully comfortable with them. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!"

I can't understand how Riemann sum translates to Integration/Antiderivative.,"Others have chimed in actually answering your question, but I just want to commend you for picking up that the connection between antiderivatives and area is a pretty cool and not entirely obvious fact. Also interesting is that we really only care about what is happening with the antiderivative at the boundary (endpoints) of the interval Generalizing, if you go through multivariable calculus, you'll continue to see some cool things we can learn about functions solely from their behavior on boundaries."
I can't understand how Riemann sum translates to Integration/Antiderivative.,"One thing you could think about is what this looks like in the 'discrete' situation.  

[https://imgur.com/a/36BtGCj](https://imgur.com/a/36BtGCj)  

Pictured are little line segments of slope 3, one of slope 1, -2, 1.   

Since slope is rise/run, we can find the rise within each interval by rise = slope x run.  If I add all these little rises I get  
3 + 1 + -2 + 1 = 3 and you can see that indeed overall the function raised by 3 from x=0 to x=4.

Now a general function is not composed of line segments like this, but you can think of it as being composed of 'infinitely many infinitely thin line segments'.   
  
 In this case, 'run' gets replaced by dx (infinitesimal run) and the slope is the derivative f'(x).    
f'(x)dx represents the infinitesimal rise in the function at x.    
Integrating these rises (like adding the rises before) gives the overall rise.

I sometimes find the discrete situation easy to picture and you can kind of let your brain fill in the gap."

I can't understand how Riemann sum translates to Integration/Antiderivative.,"I struggled with this about a year ago. Here is what finally made it make sense to me.

Say we have a function f(x) where we want to find the area under the curve. What we want to do is multiply the change in x by the average value of y over an interval. This is width \* height.

How do we find the average value of y? We pretend that f(x) is the derivative of some other function F(x) which we can find by taking the antiderivative of f(x). Since f(x) is the derivative of F(x), and we know the derivative of a function represents the slope, we know the average value of y for f(x) is the average slope over an interval on F(x).

Now lets take a closer look at F(x). If we want to find the average slope between two points on F(x), we can take the rise over the run, Δy/Δx. If we want to find the change in y over that interval, we can take the slope times the change in x, which is (Δy/Δx)\*Δx = Δy. The change in y is the same as F(y1) - F(y2).

Notice that this is exactly the same as the calculation you would do with an definite integral. Also notice that (Δy/Δx)\*Δx is the change in x times the average slope, which is width\*height of f(x).

This is exactly the same value as the limit of the Reimann sum as the width of the rectangles approaches 0, and I guess this is more precisely the definition of the integral, but I never loved that explanation because it doesn't connect area to the anti-derivative."
I can't understand how Riemann sum translates to Integration/Antiderivative.,You are not crazy. This is a great question and it goes to the heart of why a conventional calculus 1 course misses the major theoretical points. Arguably the most important theorem in calculus is the mean value theorem. It is the connective tissue between differentiation and integration.
I can't understand how Riemann sum translates to Integration/Antiderivative.,"Here’s the standard story but using different words:

First, remember that the derivative of a function is itself a function. What is its value for each input ? I view it as the sensitivity of the original function to a small change in input. In other words, a small change in input causes a small change in output, and the sensitivity is the ratio of the change in output over the change in input. If on the other hand, you know the sensitivity and a small change in input, the resulting change in output is the change in input times the sensitivity. 

Ok. Now suppose you want to know how much the output changes if the input changes a lot but all you know is the sensitivity for each input. What would you do? Here’s a simple strategy: break the large change in input into a sequence of small changes. You can then estimate the change of output for each small change of input. The total net change in output is the sum of all these changes in output. 

This however only gives you an estimate. But if the function is a nice one and you take the limit as the size of the small changes in input goes to zero, then the estimated  net change in output converges to the exact value. 

The process described of using the sensitivity function to recover the change in output is called the integral of the sensitivity function. So the above description shows that the integral of a sensitivity from a starting input to an ending input is equal to the net change in the output. 

This explains what the definition of an integral is and why the fundamental theorem of calculus is a natural consequence."
I can't understand how Riemann sum translates to Integration/Antiderivative.,"The definite integral, as you said, gives you the precise area under the curve. At the limit of the Riemann sum, where it gives you the precise area and is therefore the same as a definite integral, the area over a tiny rectangle increases by dx*f(x). This means that if we take the limit of the derivative we get f(x)*dx/dx which is f(x). Now, rather than thinking about the definite integral as indefinite with an extra step, you need to think of the indefinite as a generalization of the definite. So for indefinite we go ""what function will give us the area under the curve over every interval"" and we know that it has to change at the same rate as the definite integral at every point. We already showed that the slope of the definite integral is f(x) so the indefinite integral must give us the anti derivative.

(Calculus 2) How do i get faster at solving integrals? It takes me 45 minutes to get one answer on my homework,"Are these definite integrals or indefinite integrals? For definite integrals, it helps to know when you can use symmetry to evaluate terms quickly. For instance:

* If f is an odd function, meaning it satisfies f(-x) = -f(x), then the integral of f over any symmetric interval \[-a,a\] is zero. Examples of these are odd power functions and sine.
* If f is an even function, meaning it satisfies f(-x) = f(x), then the integral of f over any symmetric interval \[-a,a\] is twice the integral of f over \[0,a\]. That's often easier and more reliable to evaluate because you subtract F(0) (which is often 0) rather than F(-a) (which is often negative). Examples of these are constant functions, even power functions, and cosine

Can this be solved using gamma function. Integral of 0 to pi/2 (cosx)½ sin³x dx,"You can perhaps use the *Beta* function, which can be written in terms of Gamma functions, and we note that it is of the integral form:

For example, if we have the following,

∫ cos(x) · (1-cos^(2)(x))^(2) · (1-sin(x)) dx

and since 1-cos^(2)(x) = sin^(2)(x), then if we set sin(x) = t, giving us dt = cos(x)dx, then we can rewrite our integral as so-assuming our bounds of integration are from 0 to 1 with respect to t:

B(5, 2) = ∫ t^(4) · (1-t)^(1) dt

"An airplane flies from point A to point B and turns back. During the flight along AB, a wind blows with a speed of 10 m/s. The speed of the airplane relative to the air is 90 m/s. Determine the average speed during the entire journey. Which journey takes longer: in calm weather or in windy weather?","The ground speeds are 80 and 100, not 80 and ~~70~~90.

The average ground speed is less than 90 because the plane has to spend more time at the lower speed than the higher one.

If u is the wind speed and v the airspeed, then given a distance d, and times t1 and t2, (v-u)t1=d and (v+u)t2=d. The average ground speed is 2d/(t1+t2). So:

t1=d/(v-u)  
t2=d/(v+u)  
t1+t2=d/(v-u)+d/(v+u)

We want a common denominator, so:

t1+t2=d(v+u)/(v^(2)-u^(2))+d(v-u)/(v^(2)-u^(2))  
=(dv+du+dv-du)/(v^(2)-u^(2))  
=2dv/(v^(2)-u^(2))

If you know a formula for cos(a+b), you can apply it twice. (If you don't, you can derive it from a geometric construction.)

If you know complex numbers you can use de Moivre's law or Euler's formula."
Derivation,"We can use the angle sum formula to derive a formula for cos(3x) Recall that the angle sum formula for cosine is: cos(A + B) = cos(A) * cos(B) - sin(A) * sin(B)


2 Let's express cos(3x) as cos(2x + x) Applying the angle sum formula:


cos(3x) = cos(2x + x) = cos(2x) * cos(x) -sin(2x) * sin(x)


3 We need to express cos(2x) and sin(2x) in terms of cos(x) and sin(x) We use the double angle formulas:


cos(2x) = cos^2 (x) - sin^2 (x) sin(2x) = 2sin(x) * cos(x)


4 Substitute the double angle formulas into the equation from Step 2:


cos(3x) = (cos^2 (x) - sin^2 (x)) * cos(x) -(2sin(x) * cos(x)) * sin(x)


5 Expand and simplify:


cos(3x) = cos^3 (x) - sin^2 (x) * cos(x) -2sin^2 (x) * cos(x) cos(3x) = cos^3 (x) - 3sin^2 (x) * cos(x)


6 To express the formula solely in terms of cos(x) we use the Pythagorean identity.
sin^2 (x) = 1 - cos^2 (x) Substituting this:


cos(3x) = cos^3 (x) - 3(1 - cos^2 (x)) * cos(x) cos(3x) = cos^3 (x) - 3cos(x) + 3cos^3 (x) cos(3x) = 4cos^3 (x) - 3cos(x)"

Near x = a, you expand f(x) = f(a) + \[f'(a) (x - a)/1!\] + \[f''(a) (x - a)\^2 / 2!\] + ...

If you write it in the form you're using with h's where x = a + h, then

f(a + h) = f(a) + \[f'(a)h/1!\] + \[f''(a) \* h\^2 / 2!\] + ...

[graduate school] help understanding basic proof that a map is injective if and only if it has a left inverse.,"Existence of left-inverse implies injectivity is quite straightforward. Assume f(x)=f(y). You just need to prove x=y to show that f is injective. Use the assumption that f has a left-inverse g.  

Injectivity implies existence of left-inverse requires you to construct a well-defined left-inverse for f. Given that f:A->B is injective, how can you construct a function g:B->A so that g•f=id_A? In order to do this construction, you might have to split the set B into image(f) and its complement since f is not necessarily surjective. Draw some pictures to help you develop some ideas. What should g do on the subset image(f) of B? What can g do on the rest of the set? Check that this constructed g satisfies g•f=id_A. 

———

The proof for right-invertible if and only if surjective follows similar ideas as the above, but you need to work with the definition of surjectivity instead."
[graduate school] help understanding basic proof that a map is injective if and only if it has a left inverse.,"So to prove that if f in injective then there exists g:B -> A such that gf(x) = x for all x in A:

Assume f is injective, and then define a suitable g.  For any y in B, there are two possibilities: 

EITHER y = f(x) for some x in A, and then we define g(y) = x - this is well-defined because f is injective (in other words there is only one x such that y = f(x)) 

OR y ≠ f(x) for any x in A, then you can choose anything you like for g(y), ie g(y) = a where a is any element of A (assume A is non-empty).

Can you then explain why g has the required left-inverse property.

.

To prove that if such g exists then f is injective, assume we have g:B->A with gf(x) = x for all x in A.  Now take f(a) = f(b) and do the only thing you can do - apply g.

.

For the surjective / right-inverse case, if surjective you can construct a g by noting that for any y in B there is at least one x such that f(x) = y.  If right-inverse exists, then take any y in B and show you can always find x in A such that f(x) = y."

Need help building intuition for matrix pseudoinverse instabilities,"I'm not sure if its something you already know or if it really helps but maybe (I haven't dug into how exactly you set up the matrices, so this is rather general about the SVD and what exactly you're computing):

If the SVD of A is USV\^(T) then pinv(A) = V pinv(S) U\^(T) where pinv(S) is the transpose of S with all nonzero elements inverted. This is in particular an SVD of pinv(A) (up to reordering the singular values), so the singular values of the pseudoinverse are the inverses of those of A. Hence the small singular values of A correspond exactly to the large ones of pinv(A).

If you were to compute the SVD of A, threshold the singular values and then multiply the result back together (so without inversion) you'd obtain a [low-rank approximation of A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-rank_approximation), and what you'd compute is really the pseudoinverse of this low-rank approximation. The variational characterization here is that taking the r largest singular values of A yields precisely the best approximation to A with rank (at most) r with respect to the frobenius norm (which is the normal euclidean norm you'd get after vectorizing the matrix), i.e. it solves the problem

    minimize ‖A - D‖ over all matrices D such that rank(D) <= r.

Moreover the optimal value achieved in this minimization is the euclidean norm of the singular values that were ""thrown away"". So as long as those are small, the approximation is ""good"".

Now if you instead take only the smallest singular values (which is what you're doing on the side of the pseudoinverse) you essentially remove such a rank-r approximation from your matrix and only consider what's left over afterwards:

If we denote by Aᵣ the best rank-r approximation to r (i.e. the one with thresholded singular values) and by A^(†) the pseudoinvese, then (looks somewhat nasty) (Aᵣ)^(†) = A^(†) \- (A^(†))ₙ₋ᵣ (where n=rank(A)) or equivalently A^(†) = (Aᵣ)^(†) \+ (A^(†))ₙ₋ᵣ i.e. the true pseudoinverse is the one of the rank-r approximation to A plus some low(er)-rank correction; and what you're computing is precisely the true pseudoinverse \*without\* that low-rank correction.

By the previous variational characterization we have that ‖A^(†) \- (A^(†))ₙ₋ᵣ‖² is precisely sum_{i=n-r+1}^(n) σᵢ(A^(†))² where σᵢ(A^(†)) = 1/σ_{n-i+1}(A) so
‖A^(†) \- (A^(†))ₙ₋ᵣ‖ = sum_{i=n-r+1}^(n) 1/σ_{n-i+1}(A)² = sum_{j=1}^(r) 1/σⱼ(A)². 

Now if you pick a large r (i.e. a small threshold so that many singular values ""survive"") then this sum includes 1/σⱼ(A)² for some (very) small σⱼ(A) which in turn causes the norm to blow up. So there's really a tradeoff here from the theoretical side: the closer you get to the true pseudoinverse by including more singular values, the more its norm will blow up, which in turn means that the entries of the matrix have to get larger which is what you're seeing. I'm not sure if there's a way around that when using this general approach.

If there's no better idea: you can try applying some equilibration algorithm to your matrices to improve the conditioning but I'm not super familiar with that space."

"Can someone explain me exercise 12.5 Peter J. Eccles's ""Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning"".","You are looking for the coefficient of ""x^n "" in the expansion of (1+x)^(2n). We can get it using the ""Binomial Theorem"" (BT) in two different ways:

    (1+x)^{2n}  =  ∑_{k=0}^{2n}  C(2n;k) * x^k           // BT    (1)

probability that you will get 7 cards of the same suit if you draw n cards (obviously n ranging from 7 to 24) without replacing each card after it is drawn,"Why is ""24"" obvious?"
probability that you will get 7 cards of the same suit if you draw n cards (obviously n ranging from 7 to 24) without replacing each card after it is drawn,"For any a, b, c, d, where n = (a+b+c+d) then the probability of getting exactly a Clubs, b Diamonds, c Hearts, d Diamonds is

p(a,b,c,d) = 13Ca * 13Cb * 13Cc * 13Cd / 52Cn

Here nCr is the number of ways of choosing r distinct items from n distinct items: 52Cn is the total number of ways of choosing those n cards from the pack (order irrelevant), and then 13Ca will be the number of ways of choosing a Clubs, and we combine that with the 13Cb ways of choosing b Hearts etc.

The formula for nCr is n! / {r! (n-r)!}

So, the probability that you do NOT get at least 7 of at least one suit is going to be the sum of p(a,b,c,d) summing over all cases where a+b+c+d = n, and a, b, c, d < 7.

[REPOST (originally posted in r/mathematics)] My teacher taught us to never cancel/divide out variables,"You should be *cautious* when dividing by an expression containing variables, because it might equal 0 for some values of the variable and you can't divide by 0. It's not that you can't in every instance, but you have to worry about that possibility.

For example in solving the equation x\^2 = x. You could divide both sides by x giving you x = 1 and that is a solution. But you'd have to separately check whether x could be 0, i.e. whether 0 solves this equation. So the conclusion is ""If x is not 0, then x = 1. But x could also be 0.""

Instead we teach students to solve this a different way, by factoring:

x\^2 - x = 0

x(x - 1) = 0

Therefore either x = 0 or x - 1 = 0.

In your example x - x = 0 for all values of x, so you just can't divide by it."
[REPOST (originally posted in r/mathematics)] My teacher taught us to never cancel/divide out variables,"I think what your teacher is trying to get across is that when you cancel factors on both sides of an equation you have to make sure they're (edit: NOT) both 0. Because trying to divide by zero leads to contradictions like what you see here. It's fine to cancel something that you know can't be 0. Or you can cancel things as long as you deal with the case when they are 0 separately.

When students cancel thoughtlessly they often end up getting rid of things that were solutions to the equation before canceling."
[REPOST (originally posted in r/mathematics)] My teacher taught us to never cancel/divide out variables,"Cancelling out is not a thing, what you do is apply the same operation on both sides of the equation, but the operation needs to be valid. (x - x) is 0 so you can't divide both sides by that."
[REPOST (originally posted in r/mathematics)] My teacher taught us to never cancel/divide out variables,"you can only do “reversible” (injective) operations when working with equalities, in this case you’re canceling (dividing) x-x, which is dividing by 0. i think he’s avoiding to overcomplicate the explanation by making you be able to tell exactly what you’re doing instead of just canceling for the sake of it, you could explain this to him but i think he already knows it (i would hope so if he’s teaching math), but it is good practice to know what you’re canceling instead of just doing it"
[REPOST (originally posted in r/mathematics)] My teacher taught us to never cancel/divide out variables,"His conclusion is wrong, in this case ""cancelling out"" is just dividing both sides by an expresion. Your term (x -x) although in a more elaborated form, is still 0. So what you are literally doing is dividing by 0, which is an undefined operation, hence the undefined behavior. And he makes the same mistake again when saying that 2x = x implies 2 = 1, since the only value that proves for the ecuation is x = 0 ( 2(0) = 0 ), you cannot divide by x.

So the rule is, you can always cancel out terms if you ensure they are not 0"
[REPOST (originally posted in r/mathematics)] My teacher taught us to never cancel/divide out variables,"Your teacher is right and wrong. If the possibility of dividing by 0 exists, then you should be careful. If it doesn‘t (e.g. e^(x)/e^(x)), then you can cancel without any concerns sinde ex > 0 for all x element C"
[REPOST (originally posted in r/mathematics)] My teacher taught us to never cancel/divide out variables,"Whenever dividing by a function of x, f(x), a constraint is added of f(x) ≠ 0.  For example, if we divide by x^2 - 1, then a constraint is added of x^2 - 1 ≠ 0, i.e. x ≠ 1,-1.

Here, dividing by x - x adds a constraint of x - x ≠ 0, but this means x ≠ x, which is never true (depending on how you write your steps, this would be a contradiction)."
[REPOST (originally posted in r/mathematics)] My teacher taught us to never cancel/divide out variables,"An important lesson here is that when solving polynomial equations, it's almost always correct to move everything to one side and look for factors.

[REPOST (originally posted in r/mathematics)] My teacher taught us to never cancel/divide out variables,"When you have `f(x)g(x) = f(x)h(x)`, and you want to divide out `f(x)` to get `g(x) = h(x)`, you can do that, but there is a caveat. What if `f(x) = 0`? In that case, the original equation is `0 = 0`, so `g(x)` does not necessarily equal `h(x)`.

In other words, you can't go straight to `g(x) = h(x)`. The correct statement to conclude is:

    ( f(x) = 0 ) OR ( ( f(x) ≠ 0 ) AND ( g(x) = h(x) ) )

Edit: If you can show `f(x) ≠ 0` then you can conclude `g(x) = h(x)`. Or if you can show `f(x) = 0`, then that's all you can conclude and you can't say anything about `g(x)` and `h(x)`. If you can't show `f(x)` is zero or nonzero then you need to keep considering both cases as you solve."
[REPOST (originally posted in r/mathematics)] My teacher taught us to never cancel/divide out variables,"He used this to show why you cannot divide by 0. Canceling variables is necessary for many solutions.

For example, you can cancel out x from 4x/x because x already cannot be 0 in this expression, so you're not dividing by 0 here. You're dividing by x, which can be any value *except* 0. 

My hope here is that maybe you misinterpreted your teacher's lesson. Or maybe he was just bad at explaining it, which oughtn't be the case, but sometimes even teachers can mess up. 

This is a fun little exercise to teach students to consider everything because it's easy to run roughshod over new students and make them question everything."

[REPOST (originally posted in r/mathematics)] My teacher taught us to never cancel/divide out variables,"It’s not never

It’s sometimes yes sometimes no"
[REPOST (originally posted in r/mathematics)] My teacher taught us to never cancel/divide out variables,"His conclusion is you cannot cancel variable ever with mult/div. You’re kind of right, there are circumstances you can cancel out variables with these, but with the caveat you generally have to keep track of how those canceled variables limited something in the equation (usually by limiting the domain). 

In terms of proving his conclusion is false, he simply didn’t provide sufficient evidence to actually assert it as true- his statement is that for all equations you cannot cancel variables using mult/div, and he proved that with a singular example that follows that conclusion, which is not a sufficient proof for a “for all” style statement. What he actually proved is “there exists at least one equations where you cannot cancel variables using mult/div”. Proving the opposite of his original statement (ie proving “there exists at least one equation for which you can cancel variables with mult/div” by finding an example that holds) would be sufficient to prove this absolute statement is incorrect.

All that said however, he’s kind of right. In most situations, you cannot mult/div out variables from equations without taking it into account elsewhere. For instances, if I have (x+1)/x = y, I cannot simply multiply both sides by x because then I get x+1 =xy,  which doesn’t hold for x=0. Often if you’re canceling out variables with mult/div you need to limit the domain in some way, for instance in the above if you add the caveat that is true for x doesn’t equal 0, then you’re fine. 

Tbh I’m struggling to come up with an example of when it is fine to cancel out variables by dividing them out like this without considering it in some capacity (such as with the domain) if you don’t already have some context elsewhere, such as domain information, that makes the issue that arises from div/mult x irrelevant. If you have a singular example that would be sufficient to prove his statement wrong, that It isn’t true that “for every equation, you cannot mult/divide variables”, however sort of regardless of if his statement is true or not it is something you should follow in nearly all cases unless you know how you’re taking the issue that arises from doing so into account (and that issue is almost always something to do with x=0 btw).

Edit: to put it more simply, you can’t divide by zero (or really multiply equations by zero because it makes them meaningless), cancelling variable risks accidental doing one of these operations with zero, since the variable could equal zero, so unless you already know the case you’re multiplying/dividing by will never equal zero, you can’t do the operation. If you don’t have a domain limit on a variable, it could be zero, so without some context, such as a domain limit, you can’t div/mult an equation with a variable because that variable could be zero and you can’t do those operations on an equation with zero (in the case of div because it’s undefined behavior, in the case of multiplication because it can make the equation lose information)."
[REPOST (originally posted in r/mathematics)] My teacher taught us to never cancel/divide out variables,"He's not wrong but perhaps could have explained the ramifications a little more clearly.

And it's true I often see students blithely ""canceling"" a factor like (x-y) without making note of the ramifications.  Because dividing both sides by (x-y), or cancelling it out from the numerator/denominator is a perfectly fine and good thing to do - *as long as (x-y) != 0.*   And that is a *very* important stipulation!

Things you can - and really *should* \- do whenever ""cancelling"" things in a fraction, or dividing both sides of an equation by something:

1. Note whether the thing you are dividing by/cancelling can EVER by zero.  If it is NEVER zero you are good to go.
2. If it can in some circumstances = 0, then make a NOTE of it there and put some big stars or something around it so that you don't forget about it. ""TRUE ONLY IF (x-y) != 0"" or something like that
3. When you get done with the calculations, you also need to pull that exception down and it becomes part of your final answer.  *This answer* (whatever it is) *is true only when (x-y) != 0.*
4. Then also be sure to cover the situation where (x-y) = 0. Usually this involves going back to your original equation, setting x-y=0 (or whatever your specific thing was that equaled 0) and then working things through to see what happens.  Often in cases where you are trying to find the zeroes of polynomial, say, it will result in an extra case where the equation is always zero when x-y=0, so you get one, or even a whole lot, of extra zeroes.  Other times the function just blows up to infinity, becomes indeterminate, or whatever at those values.  So that is something you need to note in your final result.

From a big-picture perspective, understanding this type of thing can be a big step forward in your mathematical maturity.

Almost everything you do in math, there is an ""if A then I can do B"" type of situation.  People tend to memorize a lot of ""rules"" to follow to solve problem, almost always the rule they remember is the B part, but they completely forget about the A part.

If you start trying to understand the underlying math enough to understand the A, and why B depends on it, then you'll go a lot further - and make a lot less mistakes.

FWIW remembering the B but forgetting the A is how people will get results that appear to work with some quick checks, but then in reality work sometimes but not all the time.

Best to sort this type of thing out right from the start.  Before, say, spending a few hundreds of thousands tooling up to build a part that works most of the time but then unexpectedly fails in a few critical circumstances (true story)."
[REPOST (originally posted in r/mathematics)] My teacher taught us to never cancel/divide out variables,"X^<2-x^2=0 is true because it is just one number minus itself and it is true for all x but it doesn't follow from the equation 0^2-0^2=0  after that .theres no problem dividing by an expression involving a variable unless for a particular value of that variable the term you want to cancel has a value 0. Obviously this is always the case for the term x-x.
The restriction to Nonzero terms is not arbitrary but easily understood in terms of the properties of the numbers themselves before you get to cancelling out whole terms in polynomial equations.often a,×b=a×c implies B=c
But this cannot apply if a=0 because x×0=0 for all values of x

So whatever b and c are 0×b=0×csince they are both 0
The difference of two squares is indeed the product of their sum and their differences and that applies for all values of x.  using the number 0 in place of a variable like X or y is just confusing the issue it would be  the same fallacy if your teacher had used any other particular number in the first few equations instead of 0 for example 2001^2-2001^2=0.= the general formula implies the particular case but not.vice Versa. It may be a coincidence or part of the confidence trick that 0,0, is abused in the preliminary  as well as the example of spurious cancellation

[Differential Equations (but really algebra)] Factoring a reducible equation to an irreducible equation.,"Usually you just look for a way to figure out just one of the roots of these cubics or quartics, im not aware of a quick method that works for all cases. Once you know one root, you can factor the corresponding linear factor out of the polynomial, and end up with a polynomial of a smaller degree to factor which is usually much easier.

Actually if the root you find is complex, and if the polynomial has real coefficients, then you will straight away have found a quadratic factor. (as the complex conjugate is also a root).

For your specific polynomial, I first think of plugging smaller numbers like 1,-1,2,-2, but that doesnt work. However There is a trick to spot pure imaginary roots, as is the case here.

Look for solutions of the form x=ai, where a is a real onstant, and i is the imaginary unit. You will see that the polynomial splits into parts with even powers and odd powers (of a). the even part will be the real part, and the odd power will be the imaginary part. Now it is easy to see that a=1 or -1 sets both these parts to 0 and therefore +-i are roots. and you can factor our x^2 + 1.

To spot these quickly instead of doing a calculation, just look at the even and odd parts of your polynomial seperately and think about if things seem like they cancel out on plugging small integer values, and accounting for signs due to powers of i."
[Differential Equations (but really algebra)] Factoring a reducible equation to an irreducible equation.,"Is this an exercise out of a book? It is tedious and as you point out an algebra problem. Many classes don't really cover this.

Preparing for My Freshman Year as a Computational Math Major with a Computer Science Focus,I assume that you are in Grade 12. What math courses have you taken in high school?
Trouble with graphing trigonometry.,"It would be helpful if you gave more specific examples of what you need to do. Do you mean graphing things like y = 2sin(x+pi/3)?

Generally, I would start with the basic graphs and completely understand and memorize them. Start with sinx, cosx and tanx. You should know what they look like, where they cross the axes, where the turning points are, where the asymptotes are etc.

Then I would learn all of the graph transformation rules very well. If you know what f(x) looks like, what does f(x+h) look like? What about f(x) + h? What about k\*f(x)? What about combinations of these things?"
Trouble with graphing trigonometry.,"This is easier when you build it up step by step.  Here is how it goes.

y = sin(x) <- starting point, this is a periodic function with midpoint 0, amplitude 1, period 2pi.

y= a\*sin(x) <- a is an amplitude multiplier, for example if a = 2, your amplitude is 2.

y=a\*sin(x) + d <- d is your vertical movement (up and down) to shift your midpoint.

y = a\*sin(x - c) + d <- c is your horizontal shift, so if for example c = pi, you're shifting the line left by pi.  Have to remember that a *positive* c means a *negative* shift.

y = a\*sin(b(x-c)) + d <- b is your horizontal squeeze.  This one is the one that messes people up the most, especially if expanded.  Don't expand it if you can avoid it because it is way more confusing.  So you know that the default period is 2pi, the b is actually the divisor, so if say b is pi, your period will be 2pi/pi, or 2, which means you squeezed the period.

If you expand it then you have a more complicated expression where your shift is also squeezed, so if you have to do that, do it at the very end, and if you have to interpret an expanded function factor out the b so it's easier to parse.

y = cos(x) is just y = sin(x), but it's shifted left by pi/2.  You can actually make them identical, the two functions y = sin(x) and y = cos( x - pi/2) are the same.  Try it in desmos for a while and you'll see.

Once you turn this complicated problem into a set of easy ones it isn't too bad.  The rest of it is just volume of practice to burn it in.

  
EDIT: also, don't forget that you can either shift it a lot to invert it, or flip it using a negative value for a."

How did you even learn math in uni?,"you're presumably in a lower-division course with 600 students, unreliable TAs and a prof who'd rather be doing anything than teaching you. it's good that you're engaged, that counts for a lot. the unfortunate truth of the vast majority of lower-division technical courses at university is that you have to teach yourself.

where in ""math"" are you? 2nd semester...of what? what's the actual problem? pacing is always bad, especially at quarter-system schools."
How did you even learn math in uni?,"Don't be discouraged. But do try to assess your time management and adjust it to university. This is one of the biggest challenges. For a math/CS program, one guideline is that if you're not spending at least 2-3 hours a day in the library, you're likely not putting in the required time.

In school, the pace of learning is slow relative to college. Most high school classes require sort of a 1:1 (or less) class vs self study and maybe a 1:1 (or so) class to homework/practice. So every hour of class requires less than 2 additional hours of work/study. The ratio is quite different in college. You might end up needing 1:3 class to study time ratio and a 1:3 on homework/tutorial. So an hour of classes might require 6 additional hours of work/study. In high school, you'd go through maybe half a textbook in a class semester while college may require 2 textbooks per class per semester (so roughly 3 to 4 times the pace of study). None of this is automatic so expect that you'll need some time (1-2 semesters) to adjust. 

Most universities will recommend something like 2-3 ""core"" classes plus 1-2 ""non-core electives"" at most per semester/quarter. Some ""core"" classes are tough (4 credit courses in the US parlance) and taking more than 1 or 2 per semester will kill your schedule. Planning ahead (a year or two) is therefore essential to allow you to take the required basic classes early and spread out the tough ones. Bad planning means you might end up squeezing your core classes because of lack of pre-reqs and end up with a terrible back end schedule in order to finish the 4 year program in 4 years. 

It is financially difficult but taking an additional year to finish is not a disaster."

1. Take a deep breath, don't berate yourself. Realize that the math class is designed for an abstract student, and that is not necessarily where your level is going to be when you start the class.
2. Use the challenging parts of a class as a way to highlight your knowledge gaps. Then backfill that knowledge on your own using other resources. The first 3 weeks of math classes can be brutal because you might discover you have a lot of gaps. That's normal!
3. Focus on precision, rigor, and motivation. Know your definitions. Know the ""why do people care"" part too. Don't just read solutions; ask yourself how you can come up with a solution. 
4. If you're stuck, rewind to the last problem that semi-makes-sense-but-not-really, and overlearn that. Math is not a ""spend more time, see more results"" subject. You'll see better results by knowing 1-2 things really well than 10 things at a mediocre level."

What aspects of math do you actually enjoy?

I had to do calculus, linear algebra, and stats courses for computer science, and none of it was enjoyable.

I memorized formulas and techniques and used that to squeeze by. Fortunately, the exams didn't require me to apply my understanding of math to solve problems and only tested whether I can memorize things.

If you gave me a little math problem where you're optimizing budget or something, I'd probably enjoy it, but anything beyond that, like actual math, just puts me to sleep."

I want to learn calculus,"
getting ahead on calculus right after precalc means your brain is already warmed up on functions and limits
you don’t need to go crazy with long lectures either

try starting with just understanding what a derivative is
it’s the slope of a curve, the rate something changes
then look at how that turns into rules like the power rule or product rule
you can even practice a few problems by hand
no pressure, just messing around

you could try sites like khan academy, paul’s online math notes, or desmos to see graphs move in real time

If you find yourself wanting to dive into things more after you'd gotten to 100% on Calc 1 (all units and the course challenge), find a set of Calc 1 exercises online and do them - there are a hundred different decent, free calc 1 question banks for you to build volume to really burn in the concepts.

Struggling with simple things while being in  college,"It sounds like you have bad habits and you're not taking your time.

First, slow down... and I mean real slow.

Do one step at a time. 

STOP TRYING TO DO MATH IN YOUR HEAD. Are you capable of doing math in your head? Yes. But it leads to bad habits. Stop doing it. Do everything by hand... nice and slow.

5 - 7 + 14 =

Do this problem.... but do it slow.

The first step is to recognize PEMDAS. Even if you need to write the rule, do it. Who cares what you have to do to help you out. Take the time to do it. It's not a race. Subtraction and addition from left to right. You have subtraction to addition. Follow the rule.

The second step is to follow PEMDAS...

5 - 7 = -2

-2 + 14 = 12

Answer: 12

Doing it step by step is okay!!! It's not a race. 

Here's another one:

4 - 5 × 2 - 3 + 5 = 

Recognize what's happening and the rules. Write down the rule if it helps you. Again, it's okay! If it helps you get the right answer do it! There's multiplication, subtraction, and addition. The rule is to do multiplication first. Then to do subtraction and addition from left to right.

4 - 5 × 2 - 3 + 5 = 

First rule: Multiply

.... 5 x 2 = 10

4 - 10 - 3 + 5 = 

Second rule: Subtraction/ addition from left to right

A. There's subtraction. 

....4 - 10 = - 6

-6 - 3 + 5 = 

B. There's Subtraction.

....-6 - 3 = -9 

-9 + 5 =

C. There's addition, the last step:

-9 + 5 = -4

Answer: 4 - 5 × 2 - 3 + 5 = -4

I know that it's difficult to take your time. It takes longer to get the answer. But you will get the right answer as long as you understand the rules. If you don't understand PEMDAS then you need to review and go back and relearn it.

When you are learning math, take your time with it. Write everything out. Make it dumb as bricks to follow along. Do NOT do weird tricks. Don't do it in your head. Just plain, simple, and step-by-step. Will you like doing it the slow way? Probably not.

If it helps you visualize better, get some blocks or things that you have many of, and do the math while re-arranging the blocks. This will help you not cheat in your head. You will start visually seeing the blocks move.

Take it easy."

Help solving a recursive function without an obvious base case.,"The odds first wizard wins on first spell is X.

The odds they win on their second spell involves the first spell missing (1-X), the first spell from the other wizard missing (1-Y), and then hitting the second spell (X).

The odds they win on their third spell involves both wizards missing twice, (1-X)^(2)(1-Y)^(2), and then the first wizard hitting, X.

Putting this all together, we get the total probability of the first wizard winning as

6th grade math been a while need some assistance,"This is not ""distributive property"" or ""pemdas"". It's an equation that you can solve.

---

I like to compare math to chess. It's not about memorizing fixed procedures. Instead, there are certain ""legal moves""; your job is to use those ""legal moves"" to figure out how to get the board to a winning configuration.

Your most important ""legal moves"" are:

- Simplify **any part** of an equation.

- Do the **same thing to both sides** of an equation.

To solve an equation, your goal is to get the variable by itself on one side, and the other side to be a plain number.

---

Like in chess, sometimes it helps just to simplify the problem. It's much easier to figure out what to do in a chess game with 3 pieces on the board than it is with 20.

Here, you can start by subtracting 3 from both sides:

> 7 + 9d = 7d + 3

> 7 + 9d - 3 = 7d + 3 - 3

And then simplify the right side...

> 7 + 9d - 3 = 7d

...and the left side.

> 7 - 3 + 9d = 7d

> 4 + 9d = 7d

Now you can subtract 9d from both sides. Then you'll end up with a number on one side, and a number *times* your variable on the other. After that, there's just one more step - see if you can do it!"

Logic in percentage calculations,"You are asking two separate questions.

Adding 20% of something gets 120% of that something.

Subtracting 20% of something gets you 80% of that something 

So subtracting 20% of 60 is asking 

""What is 100% of 60 minus 20% of 60

(100% - 20%) of 60 

(1-.2)*60

.8*60


By dividing by 1.2 you are assuming you have 120% of something and you want to know what that something is

Which means we already added 20% so that means 60 is already 100 parts plus 20 parts of something which is the same as 5 parts plus 1 part 

So if we break up 60 accordingly, we get 50 parts plus 10 parts which means we are getting that 60 is 120% of 50


More to the point, taking 80% is the same as multiplying by 80/100 or 4/5 so to 'undo' that, we would multiply by it's reciprocal or 5/4 = 1.25"
Logic in percentage calculations,"Not exactly sure what you're asking, since clearly 1/1.2 is not 0.8.

I think you're getting confused by the following idea: 

10% off of 10 is 9.

But if I add 10% to 9 shouldn't I get back to 10?

No you don't. Because percentages are always *of something*.

In the first case the percentage is applied to 10. In the second case it's applied to 9. So adding 10% (of 9!) only gets you partially back towards 10."
Logic in percentage calculations,"You said it yourself, the thing you need to do is multiply by 0.8. The relationship between 0.8 and 1.2 is through addition so trying to simulate one through the other doesn't work."
Logic in percentage calculations,X * 0.8 = X/(1/0.8)=X/1.25
Logic in percentage calculations,"you can think of the issue as what number you're starting with, either the starting number or an ending number

  
**60 \* 1.2 = X,**

so here 60 is our starting number, in a sense

60 / 1.2 = X =>

60 = X \* 1.2 =>

**X \* 1.2 = 60**

so in a way, 60 becomes our ending number, taking the place of 72.

so when you try dividing, you're asking what 20% added to what number gets 60

it doesn't care about 20% of 60, it cares about 20% of X,"
Logic in percentage calculations,"First, subtract 20% of what from x? 20% is 20% of something. If you're subtracting 20% of x from x (discounting) then it's:

20% of x subtracted from x

Which is

X-X(.20)

20%of x is literally x times .20

If you type 20% into a spreadsheet and then reformat it as a number you will see 0.20. 

20%=0.20 or 20%=20/100.

The reason that multiplying by 0.80 works is that 1-0.20=0.80.

If you want to add 20% of x to x, then

x+x(.20)"
Logic in percentage calculations,"100 reduced by 20% = 80

80 increased by 25% = 100 so

100/1.25=80"
Logic in percentage calculations,"Let's reframe it by starting with some logic that *does* work.

* Consider that if you halve something, then double it, then you get the same end result.
* What is that in percentages? Well, thats 50% less to halve it, and 100% more to double it.
* So we shouldn't expect percentages to work the way you've imagined, because it defies this example that we know works.

\---

Now, back to your question.

You ask about how to ""SUBTRACT 20% from X?"", but what does this mean exactly? How cn we express it in arithmetic? Well, we could write it like this:

* X - (0.2 \* X)

That's ""Start with X, and then work out what 20% (or a a-fifth, or 0.2) of X is, and subtract it from that starting value.""

Compare that to:

* X / 1.2

That's ""Start with X, and divide it by 1.2.""

We don't have a reason to expect that these give the same result. It doesn't seem true that:

* X - (0.2 \* X) = X / 1.2

I could try manipulating it:

* 1.2X - 0.6X = X   \[multiply both sides by 1.2\]
* 0.6X = X \[do the subtraction\]

But it is clearly false, unless X=0. (And indeed, subtracting 20% of 0 from 0 is still 0, and 0/1.2 is also 0, so this equality works for X=0, but not if X equals anything else.)"
Logic in percentage calculations,"Multiplying by 0.8 subtracts 20% of the starting number (X), while dividing by 1.2 finds the original number that X represents after having 20% of that original, smaller number added to it. Because 20% of X is a different absolute amount than 20% of the smaller number you find by dividing, the operations X * 0.8 and X / 1.2 yield different results; they are fundamentally calculating the percentage based on different values."

How to prove that finite sets have different cardinalities?,"This is one of those foundational things for which a proof depends heavily on what your context allows you to assume. You've said that you're trying to work within ZFC, but there are still underlying issues of ""what does {0,1,...,n} mean"" and ""what are the natural numbers really"". In any case, I'm going to try to give you an answer, with the main assumed background knowledge being arithmetic properties of the natural numbers. For example: No natural is less than zero, if x>0 then x=x'+1 for some x', if x+1>y+1 then x>y, etc. Also, obviously, I assume that induction works.

Notation: \[x\] = {0,1,...,x-1} = {natural numbers less than x}. (This is so that \[x\] has (intuitively) cardinality x.)

Prove by induction on n: For every m>n, there is no injection \[m\] -> \[n\]. In particular there is no bijection.

Base case: Set n=0. Then, \[n\]=\[0\] is the empty set. For m>0, \[m\] is not the empty set because 0 in \[m\].  If there were an injection (or, in fact, any function) f : \[m\] -> \[0\] we would have f(0) in \[0\] so \[0\] is not the empty set, contradiction. Thus, the base case is proven.

Induction step: Suppose that this statement has been proven for some value of n, we prove it for n+1. Suppose there is m>n+1 such that an injection exists \[m\]->\[n+1\].

First of all, since m>n+1, it must be the case that m=m'+1 with m'>n. Moreover, \[m\]=\[m'\]U{m'} and \[n+1\]=\[n\]U{n}, so we have an injection f : \[m'\]U{m'} -> \[n\]U{n}.

Now, I claim that we can, without loss of generality, assume that f(m')=n. This is because, if this is not already the case, we can compose f with the permutation of \[n\]U{n} that swaps f(m') with n.

Next, consider f' = f restricted to \[m'\]. This is still injective because restrictions of injections are injections. Moreover, since f(m')=n and f is injective, the restriction is actually an injection f : \[m'\] -> \[n\], and since we've seen m'>n, this contradicts the induction hypothesis.

This should complete the proof. Does that work out for you?"

How to prove that finite sets have different cardinalities?,"I think I've found a proof...

Assume there is a bijection f: A → B, A = {0...n}, B = {0...m}, and m>n

Then there must be something that maps to n+1, call this a₁, which is in A. That is:

a₁ = f^(-1)(n+1) ∈ A

Let A₁ = A \\ {a₁}

Then there must be an a₂ = f^(-1)(a₁) ∈ A₁, since a₁ cannot map to itself as it already maps to n+1

Continue this argument for a₁, a₂, ..., and either you'll eventually have an element not mapped to, or you'll have an infinite set of distinct points a₁, a₂, ... in {0...n}, and thus you can define a surjection from {0...n} to N.

Proof 2:

There is no surjection from {0...n} to N

A proof by induction:

Base case: { } to N

Vacuously true, since no elements can be mapped.

Assume the result is true for n-1. That is, there is no surjection from {0...n-1} to N

Assume BWOC that there is a surjection f from {0...n} to N. 

Then there is a surjection g(x) from {0...n-1} to N \\ {f(n)} 

Define h(x) = { f(x), if f(x) < f(n);  f(x)-1, if f(x) > f(n)

Then h(g(x)) is a surjection from {0...n-1} to N, which contradicts our induction hypothesis

That last item is actually extremely different from all the others---it uses two symbols instead of one symbol, and in fact one of the symbols (the `1`0) is repeat of an earlier symbol. So I would say that a pattern about digits that works for one through nine but doesn't work for ten is actually quite **expected.**"
The Multiplication Of Ones,If you want the pattern to continue you can instead do the square of sequences of n ones in base (n+1) where you also write the result in base (n+1).
"Will real analysis help me truly understand calculus, or is it just formal proofs?","It is a complicated question.  Basically it is possible to understand calculus without analysis - at least to Calculus 1 and 2.  The reason for this is that most of the theorems you dont prove in Calc, are actually stongly intuitive.  

A good analogy would be arithmetic.  It is possible to understand it without the Peano axioms, and understanding the Peano axioms will not make you a bettter at adding..

Now if you attempt analysis you will understand calculus more. But there is a catch.  It is harder to understand analysis than it is to understand calculus on an slightly informal level. You can almost think most of the theorms in calculus as axioms (mean value theorm, etc) they are so obvious.

You will need to understand calculus more if you do physics.  However this is easier than it might appear. Go back in your text book and just read the theorem stuff, and do the theorem problems - usually the last couple in the chapters. You will be fine."
"Will real analysis help me truly understand calculus, or is it just formal proofs?","As a physicist, I would generally say that analysis is not super useful for physics. (However, it is super interesting in its own right and definitely important if you want to study mathematics seriously.) The main use of calculus in physics is doing calculations, and analysis is not super useful for learning how to calculate. But let me unpack that a little bit.

Part of what analysis is trying to do is set things like the real numbers and continuity on a rigorous mathematical footing. Mathematicians need to worry very much about edge cases, and the exact conditions needed for a theorem to hold.

In physics, we very rarely need that level of precision. No number in physics is defined to an infinite number of decimal places. Functions that are relevant for physics tend to be smooth and automatically satisfy the conditions of theorems in analysis. Or, there is a physical reason for functions not to satisfy those conditions and be singular, and the singularities need to be dealt with using logic that is at least partly based in physics, where pure math on its own would not give you a unique way to proceed.

Now, what I'm not saying is that being able to calculate in physics is purely a mechanical process that involves no understanding. To the contrary, there are some quite subtle things that you do need to understand as you go deeper into physics. But in my experience, you tend to learn these concepts by doing problems and examples relevant for physics, and proofs don't really give you that experience.

Also, if you end up studying, say, differential geometry for general relativity, then it might help to know some analysis and geometry, because the level of mathematical sophistication is higher and it's useful to know some concepts from analysis like neighborhoods and metric functions. But, I didn't take an analysis class in undergrad (I self studied some of it later out of curiosity) and I ended up getting through general relativity fine. In general, physicists teach the math that is needed to understand the physics in physics classes.

To try and summarize it... calculus is a set of rules. Analysis is about building those rules -- logically establishing why the rules are true and the exact situations where they hold. Physicists are more like clients of those tools -- we don't necessarily care exactly how they are built, but what's important is knowing how to use them in situations that are important for us."
"Will real analysis help me truly understand calculus, or is it just formal proofs?","An introductory real analysis course(also called advanced calculus or intermediate analysis) is designed to rigorously justify the material that you learn in a standard calculus sequence. ""Why can only some functions be defined as continuous while others cannot?"" is an example of the types of questions that are justified in real analysis.

That being said, it wasn't my experience that taking analysis necessarily provided any more intuition for calculus. If anything, it just provided intuition for analysis if that makes sense. An introductory analysis course provides tools that are still used in more advanced analysis (graduate level and beyond). 

I'm currently in my second semester of graduate real analysis and I'm still using techniques that I learned in my very first analysis course."
"Will real analysis help me truly understand calculus, or is it just formal proofs?","Real analysis is not about intuition. I'd almost go so far as to say it's about *draining* calculus of intuition.

If you want an intuitive understanding that will allow you to manipulate expressions and convert real-world problems into mathematical language [3Blue1Brown ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM&list=PL0-GT3co4r2wlh6UHTUeQsrf3mlS2lk6x)is probably the best resource in terms of intuition. Beyond that, it might help to learn about infinitesimals (which as recently as the 1970s have been put on a rigorous foundation). Both Newton and Leibniz relied on infinitesimal thinking when *inventing* calculus, and as such a lot of the intuition behind results in calculus comes from considering quantities that are somehow ""smaller"" than any other quantity. 

Nowadays, such ideas are handled using limits, and that's what you'll learn in real analysis. But if you want to understand calculus using infinitesimals, which I personally find more intuitive, I recommend the book [Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach](https://people.math.wisc.edu/~hkeisler/calc.html) by Jerome Keisler."
"Will real analysis help me truly understand calculus, or is it just formal proofs?","You really don't need real analysis to understand any of the common calc stuff. If you're mechanically following rules for things like derivatives and integrals, most of the proofs of that stuff is well within what a calc 1 or 2 student can understand."
"Will real analysis help me truly understand calculus, or is it just formal proofs?","It kinda depends on how much of a proof you need to feel like you understand how those rules work in calculus.

"Will real analysis help me truly understand calculus, or is it just formal proofs?","Your old calculus book should have some proofs for why each of the major theorems work as well as proofs for each of the derivative rules. It should be enough to help you understand why they work.
Analysis was a lot of those proofs as well as some other interesting proofs/ideas but it was mostly formal proofs for me and not any calculations."
"Will real analysis help me truly understand calculus, or is it just formal proofs?","The answer is no. It kind of goes the opposite direction you're looking for.

Do you not understand why things work because you never did? Or because once you've got it under your belt, you're just applying it and it feels like turning a crank rather than ""understanding""?

The latter is absolutely normal. You should be able to go back and derive any rule you use. But if you can do that, you need to let go of the idea of using established rules as ""not understanding""."

Can a vector be linearly independent or only a vector set?,"Okay, so the problem here is that you (and the AI) are conflating two different sets of vectors.

The first set is the set of columns in your RREF matrix. Let's call that one RR. The second set is your set of pivot columns. Let's call that one P.

P is, by definition and construction, linearly independent. It is also a non-strict subset of RR. RR is not necessarily linearly independent; more specifically, it won't be if it contains non-zero non-pivot columns. P forms a *basis* for RR - it's a linearly independent set of vectors from which every element of RR can be constructed via linear combination.

When you perform Gaussian elimination to construct your RREF matrix, what you're doing is isolating the unique element of each row. So each pivot column represents the *linearly independent element* of a row of your matrix, which is why taken together they form a basis for RR. But it is not correct to say that your pivot columns are necessarily linearly independent with respect to the set of vectors RR itself.

For example:

\[1 0 1\]  
\[0 1 1\]

Here, RR = { (1,0), (0,1), (1,1) } and P = { (1,0), (0,1) }

RR is clearly linearly dependent.

P is clearly linearly independent.

Either of your pivot columns are linearly dependent in RR and linearly independent in P. Preserving that distinction is where the AI answer failed."

Question about pi,"Dealing with infinities gets… weird. Short answer is, since pi is an irrational number it CANT repeat, if it did you could write it as a fraction and thus it’d be rational.

Here’s a thought exercise.

Take this sequence, 1, 101, 1001, 10001, …

Now, stick those together in a single decimal.

.1101100110001100001…

That’s another number that goes on forever but never repeats. There will never be another point where the sequence 11011 occurs again. Ever.

This example uses only 2 digits, but they can be combined in infinitely many unique ways. It’s a similar story with pi. Yeah, you only got 10 digits, but there are a LOOOOOOT of ways to combine 10 digits together if you don’t care how long it gets."
Question about pi,"Consider the number 0.123456789101112131415... It is made by concatenating all positive integers. Since each integer is unique, it does not repeat, even though it never terminates."
Question about pi,"It does make repetitions of patterns, it just doesn't repeat any same pattern indefinitely. Decimal representations of rational numbers repeat one particular pattern on infinite loop, for example 1/7 repeats 142857 forever. The digits of pi don't do that, but you will for sure find for example an instance of 142857142857142857142857, the ""non-repeating"" means that all of these repetitions eventually end."
Question about pi,"0.12112111211112111112... doesn't repeat, but is predictable. In this way, it's easy to create non-repeating numbers."
Question about pi,"Repeat means that after a while you get

Question about pi,"Well, it repeats some sequences of digits sometimes, but not systematically and forever.

Sure, but then it doesn't have to follow it forever.

Maybe the trillionth to 2trillionth digits are all ""5"" (so a trillion 5s in a row). Well, maybe after that the digits beyond that point are all essentialy random."
Question about pi,"u/Zetaplx makes a great simplified way to think about it.

but also wrap your brain around this, since it *does* use all 10 digits... it's very likely that every finite numerical sequence that ever was or will be is also probably found somewhere in the infinite digits of pi.

Question about pi,"pi is an irrational number, a property of these numbers being that they can't be represented by a fraction and their decimal forms are non-terminating and non-repeating. 

To see how this is possible, consider the following number 

0.110100100010000...and so on. You can see how we can continue and this number does not ever repeat or terminate.

Question about pi,"There are proofs that pi is irrational, which means that it cannot be written as a rational fraction, i.e. we can't write pi=a/b, where a and b are integers. This is the definition of an irrational number. Suppose that pi does repeat after some number of digits. Define x=pi/10, which is some number 0.314...., which will also repeats as pi does. Now suppose that x repeats itself after N digits, where N is an non-negative integer. So,  x \* 10\^N is a number with N digits infront of the decimal point and afterwards it is just x. But this means that 10\^N x-x  is an integer, which we call z. From this we see that x= z/(10\^N-1) and thus pi=10z/(10\^N-1), which means that pi is a rational fraction. But this can't be true as pi is irrational. 

  
We see that as pi is irrational number, it cannot repeat itself."
Question about pi,"(Assuming pi is normal), any finite sequence of digits will appear in pi an infinite number of times. So in that sense, sequences repeat in pi all the time.

If pi were repeatable, it would mean that there was a digit (say the billionth digit), after which pi would only contain the same cycle of digits over and over and over again to infinity. For example, 1/14=0.071428577142857.... repeats the sequence 714285 over and over again starting at the second digit after the decimal place. That does not happen for pi so pi is not repeatable."
Question about pi,"Even if there were a sequence of digits, let's say 1003 digits long, and then the next 1003 after that were exactly the same, that doesn't mean it would have to repeat from then on.  Pi isn't a rational number i.e. we are not dealing with remainders from a division that tend to act predictably.  It's a different kind of number entirely."
Question about pi,"When people say that π does not repeat, that's not quite is what is meant. They mean that there isn't some point at which it repeats in the same way that repeating decimals do (examples: 0.51515151..., 0.912912912..., etc). This is equivalent to saying that π is irrational since all rational numbers have some sort of infinite repetition in their decimal form (even if that repetition is a bunch of 0s, such as in 5.0000000...)."
Question about pi,"Here is a question.  Are irrational numbers really part of the universe, of just part of a broken language of interpretation of said universe?  That is to say they exist in math because math is broken and unable to adequately describe those circumstances as it functions."
Question about pi,"Irrational numbers are weird. 

Imagine you used a compass to draw a circle. And then holding the radius constant, you start marking points on the circle. You do this by cantering the compass at some point at the circle and creating an arc cutting the circle, marking your first point. Then you keep doing this, each time moving the compass to the next point. 

You'll never go back to a point you previously visited. Suppose you did, and you took n steps to do it, and made m full rotations around the circle. That means n * radius = m * circumference. But that can't be, since pi is irrational. 

Sometimes, it's strange how these objects are still ""numbers""."
Question about pi,"Pi is not rational (you can prove this) => its decimal never repeats. Suppose a number has a repeating decimal. Say 0.(finite random numbers)(repeating sequence). This can always be written as a fraction, therefore it's rational. Meaning pi's decimal cannot ever infinitely repeat."
Question about pi,"what ""never repeats"" means is that it never INFINITELY repeats. it's totally possible for it to repeat, say, ""2718"" one-hundred times in a row, it's just that eventually it will stop repeating.
compare with, for example, 1/7.

1/7=0.142857142857142857...

the ""142857"" repeats FOREVER. it will never end. really, every number has a repeating decimal expansion. like 1/2=0.5000000... where the 0 repeats forever

so, every number with a repeating decimal looks like: a whole number, followed by a decimal point, followed by a string of n digits, followed by a string of m digits that repeats forever.

1/7: whole number 0, string of 0 digits, string of 6 digits that repeats forever (142857)
4/3: whole number (1), string of 0 digits, string of 1 digit that repeats forever (3)
377503/138875: whole number (2), string of 3 digits (718), string of 4 digits that repeat forever (2934)

the last one looks like 2.718293429342934...

let's prove that pi can't do this. you need to know two things:
1. pi is irrational: pi cannot be written as a fraction of two whole numbers. for example, 0.3333... can be written as 1/3, 2.71829342934... as 377503/138875, and etc., but pi cannot be written like this
2. if you take an n-digit number and divide by n 9's in a row, you get a repeating decimal with those n digits. for example, ""1234"" is 4-digits, ""9999"" is four 9's in a row, and 1234/9999=0.123412341234... with the ""1234"" continuing forever

okay. so suppose pi eventually repeats like the above examples. we have a whole number at the beginning (3), a string of n digits that don't repeat, and a string of m digits that does repeat. we don't know n and m, but we know that they will be positive, whole numbers, and that's all we need.

so, pi looks like 3.(the n digits)(string of m repeating digits forever)...

you know how multiplying by 10^1 moves the decimal point to the right by 1 digit, multiplying by 100=10^2 moves it right by 2 digits, and etc.? so if we multiply this by 10^n , we get:

3(the n digits).(m repeating digits)

now, let's call the n digits that don't repeat a (in 2.71829342934... this would be the ""718""), the m digits that do b (this is the ""2934), so what we have here is:

3•10^n +a before the decimal, and bbbb... after the decimal. since b has m digits, we can divide by m 9's to get 0.bbbbb... = b/(m 9's)

the m 9's can be written as b/(10^m -1), since 10-1=9, 100-1=99, 1000-1=999, and so on. so, in total, after multiplying pi by 10^n, we have:

3•10^n +a+b/(10^m -1) = pi•10^n

if we get a common denominator, the left hand side becomes:

((10^m -1)•(3•10^n +a)+b)/(10^m -1) = pi•10^n

now, id we divide both sides by 10^n , the right hand side just becomes pi, and on the left hand side, we can multiply 10^m -1 by 10^n (because dividing a fraction by a number means multiplying the denominator by that number). so, in total, we have:

pi = ((10^m -1)•(3•10^n +a)+b)/(10^n •(10^m -1))

now, this looks like a big mess, but there's something important here: both the numerator and denominator are whole numbers. they only involve adding, subtracting, and multiplying, which can only ever give whole numbers, never fractions or decimals. so, we have found a way to write pi as a fraction of whole numbers

but pi is irrational! it can't be written as a fraction of whole numbers. since we only made logical conclusions, it must be that our assumption was wrong: pi never has a repeating decimal expansion"
Question about pi,"You kind of have to address what you mean by repeat. If you mean ""does the same sequence appear multiple times"" then there are repetitions. 

That's not what mathematicians mean when they talk about pi not repeating. What is meant is that there isnt a single finite sequence that repeats itself continuously to infinity, which is true of pi"
Question about pi,"I think you are looking at this the wrong way. The question you should be asking is what is the likelihood that any particular sequence should repeat? For instance if I have a single digit like 3, what is the likelihood that the next digit in the sequence is 3? In base 10, it would be 1/10th. The likelihood that it repeats twice would be 1/100. You would quickly arrive at the conclusion that the sequence of repeating decimals converges to zero. In other words the likelihood that a random sequence is rational is zero. Meaning all of the measure in the number line is comprised of irrational numbers. This logic can be extended to the set of algebraic numbers like the sqrt(2), where you will arrive at the same conclusion that they have a measure of zero and therefore conclude that the measure of the number line is completely comprised of transcendental numbers like pi and e. But that is only the beginning of the paradox because it’s very difficult to show that numbers are transcendental, furthermore between every two transcendental numbers is a rational number."
Question about pi,or just write 22/7 and be done with it.
Question about pi,"If I have one digit to work with and I can choose only 0-9 for it, I have 10 possible combinations. Very limited.

Pi in base ten can also only choose between 0-9, but it doesn't just have the one digit to work with. With infinite digits, there are certainly sections that appear more than once. But the total decimal expansion doesn't display a cyclical repeating pattern. Repeated sections are more akin to coincidences.

So you might have

...823910208...

And

...723910204...

But those sections sharing most of the same digits doesn't mean the decimal expansion repeats. 2391020 appearing multiple times is not the same as pi repeating in the same way other rational numbers do.

E.g.

1/2 = 0.50000... ... 000000... ... 0000000...

Or

1/7 = 0.142857... ... 5714285714... ...142857..."
Question about pi,Pi only looks like our Pi because we have ten fingers.  Is Pi still non-repeating in base 8 or 16?
Question about pi,"Pi does not go on forever. It's just a ratio of the area of a circle to its radius.  It's a bit bigger than 3.

The digits of pi in any base will never ""terminate"" or ""repeat"".   This is difficult to study and completely unproven, but it is conjectured that pi is normal in every natural base - meaning its digits are effectively random. Imagine rolling a d10 forever.

When we say ""repeat"" though that means repeat forever.  For instant 0.333... means the 3 repeats forever.  The chance of that happening at random is 0.  This certainly doesn't happen with pi.  If it repeated it would be rational (a ratio of two integers) and we know that it isn't.

In a normal number though any given set of digits will be repeated infinitely many times.  For instance the sequence ""314159265"" would occur within pi infinitely many times.   They'd also occur infinitely many times back to back.  Every finite sequence of digits you can name occurs infinitely many times within the base 10 representation of any normal-in-base-10 number.  Same as if you rolled a d10 forever.

What is very unlikely to happen is for the *starting* digits to ever repeat, even once.  Say the first digits are ""314"" this would mean the next digits are also ""314"".  The odds of that happening are 1/1000, and obviously the next actual digits are not 314.  The odds of it happening at any point in the 3 *or more* first digits is 1/1000 + 1/10,000 + 1/100,000 which converges to a small number.  Even though there are an infinite number of d10 rolls, the probability of a repeat falls even faster.  We know these digits don't repeat in any of the digits we've found (a lot) so the remaining probability is effectively zero.

Again, these statements are assuming pi is normal in base 10.  100% of real numbers are normal in base 10, but naming even a single number we've proven to be normal is hard."
Question about pi,"My totally uneducated opinion is that it is possible that pi could repeat, but it isn't strictly necessary. It seems possible that you could arrange the 9 digits to infinity without ever repeating pi. Also if pi is infinitely large, when would it repeat itself? Where would the start and end point be?"
Integration by substitution problem,"This requires the use of a trigonometric substitution: x = 5 sin(θ)

See the following:

* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric\_substitution#Examples\_of\_Case%20\_I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_substitution#Examples_of_Case%20_I)

Alternatively, if we let y = sqrt(25 - x^(2)), then this leads us to the equation x^(2) \+ y^(2) = 5^(2), which represents the equation of a circle with its center at (0, 0) and a radius of 5.

So, y = sqrt(25 - x^(2)) ≥ 0 is the upper half of the circle, meaning that it lies about the x-axis, and the net-signed area is positive.

Since the integral's limits are from x = 0 to x = 5, the definite integral gives us the (net-signed) area of one-quarter of the circle in the first quadrant of the xy-plane. This area is (1 / 4) · π · 5^(2) = (25 / 4) π."

Don't jump to conclusions. It's ok to not understand something right away. When you get confused, practice just sitting and learn to be comfortable with your confusion.

If you get stuck, go back and study something simpler or more foundational. Mastering the basics is much more impressive than starting something advanced.

Do lots of practice problems. If the problems are easy you will knock them out fast, if the problems are difficult then you'll learn a lot by trying. In either case there's not a good reason to skip them.

If you're stuck on a problem (usually 30 min to an hour) **IT IS OK TO LOOK UP THE SOLUTION.** Your job is to understand the problems and their solutions, not derive all of mathematics from scratch. If you've studied a problem enough to understand why it's difficult and made multiple attempts that haven't worked, you'll learn more by studying how other people have solved it in the past than continuing to bang your head against it.

Have fun. Studying math is hard work, but very fun when done correctly. If you're ever not having fun, reevaluate your motivation and methods."
Best advice to learn math?,The best advice i can give is learn small baby steps of what your learning and slowly apply it to problems and as you do these problems slowly make them a little tougher. That's what my calculus instructor does as the homework starts with small steps of what we learned then slowly builds up into more complex problems. We take exams with a quite tough review but when the actual test comes its stupidly easy because we trained our mind to slowly build up into doing harder problems.
Best advice to learn math?,"Exercises for a few hours a day, daily for the entire stufent life. This worked for me. There's no other shortcut.

Repetition is recommended. Retake the exercise you've solved a month ago. Do the same type of exercise multiple times, until you find it repugnantly boring. Try to increase the difficulty gradually. If you don't know how to solve an exercise, spend at least 30 minutes thinking of it, and then look at the solution. Note down the exercise you couldn't solve in the first time, and retake them one week later, two weeks later, until you will know how to do them.

Grind.

There's no shortage of good books. If a book doesn't click, find another one the same subject.

Know thyself. Understand what are your weaknesses and strenghts. Some people are more visual, some people are more oriented towards numbers. 

Under no circumstances use ChatGPT or similar. They will hallucinate a lot when prompted about math, and they are very convincing when it comes to err you.

Use physical books and paper. Math requires concentration and solitude. Screens will make it harder for you if you don't have the discipline. You need a silent room, a clean desk pen and paper. 

Find people who like math, and befriend them. It's important to have an entourage that doesn't demotivate you. 

Don't get too harsh on yourself when you don't get it, math is hard. Only a few people in the world are naturally gifted for it. The rest are hard workers and grinders in their formative years. And even those who are naturally gifted need to work a lot to keep up with the information. Most of the lazy but gifted people hit a wall by the time they reach calculus.

Be realistic, know your limits. Yes, you can increase them gradually, but don't overburn yourself. You will end-up hating math."
Best advice to learn math?,"Get Algebra and Trigonometry by Stewart Redlin Watson.

Quite the expensive book but the first part of this text is all the previous math you need to learn before starting algebra and Trigonometry. Algebra is the foundation of mathematics, get good at it and all other fields of mathematics will open up to you. 

If you are honest and patient with your learning you will def be a good mathematician. 

At the end of the day what really matters is perceverance and patience when it comes to these things. 

To become a genius you will need these 2 things plus obsession. I do not recomend this haha!"
Vieta substitution in solving cubic equation,"If you want to keep it in ""R"" and ""p > 0"", you may restrict ""w"" to get a bijection ""t: (0; oo) -> R"":

* ""p > 0"": Restrict ""w > 0"" 
* ""p < 0"": This will not work

Alternatively, just collect the entirety of 6 possible solutions total, without caring about bijections. Checking all of them manually is not difficult -- you will have obtained each solution to the cubic twice. That is probably the most direct approach."
Why cannot an eigenvector be a zero vector?,"Eigenvectors and eigenvalues solve Av=lv, where l is lambda, but if v can be zero, that solves for all l, then any l is an eigenvalue, so saying that e.g. 3 is an eigenvalue of some matrix loses all meaning. This, we forbid zero as an eigenvector. Note that zero can still be an eigenvalue for some eigenvector."
Why cannot an eigenvector be a zero vector?,"An eigenvector is one that doesn't change except for scaling when you multiply it by a matrix. The zero vector doesn't change, and you could say it scales by any constant you want, but this leads to all sorts of weird degeneracy: it would be the only eigenvector that doesn't have an associated eigenvalue. So, ultimately, either you say that eigenvectors are non-zero, or everywhere you price a property of eigenthings, you have to say ""ignoring the zero eigenvectors"".

Maybe think of it like why we decide not to call 1 a prime number: we could, but it's more convenient not to because it doesn't behave like all the other prime numbers."
Why cannot an eigenvector be a zero vector?,It is but we want to study tbe no trivial case. Ie the zero vector is a boring eigenvector. It's like why is one not prime or why most treatments of rings assume that you ignore the zero ring. Zero is allowed but then you lose invertibility and the nice diagonalization in terms of eigenvectors diagonal matrix whose entries are eigenvalues and the inverse of the eigenvector matrix which makes matrix multiplication so easy 
Why cannot an eigenvector be a zero vector?,"The real answer is that an eigenvector is a basis vector for an eigenspace, which is the more fundamental concept. (And basis vectors cannot be zero.) An eigenvalue has infinitely many associated eigenvectors living in an associated subspace with dimension possibly greater than one. Every eigenspace has the zero vector in it so the zero vector cannot be associated with a particular eigenspace. Now, we could define an eigenvector as an element of an eigenspace which would allow the zero vector to be an eigenvector. However, to talk about eigenvectors coherently without introducing the slightly more abstract notion of an eigenspace, we have to keep them nonzero to allow them to be associated with a unique eigenvalue/eigenspace."
Why cannot an eigenvector be a zero vector?,"Depends on how you look at it. You need to include it by definition to be able to make statements such as ""the set of eigenvectors corresponding to an eigenvalue is a linear subspace"". A linear subspace needs a zero vector. So it's a natural part of the algebraic structure.

*HOWEVER* in applications, you almost always require a nonzero vector, because that's what actually carries some useful information. Note that you can for example normalize to one any vector but the zero vector. The various decomposition techniques relying on eigensystem also need nonzero.

So to be precise, you can think of it as v≠0 being an additional constraint that appears almost everywhere, where you use eigenvectors in practice, but it's not part of the definition of an eigenvector."
Why cannot an eigenvector be a zero vector?,"An eigenvector v of a Matrix M has the property that

M*v = lambda * v

For some scalar lambda.

If v = 0

M*0 = lambda * 0 = 0

However this is always true as anything times 0 is 0, it doesn't really tell you anything about the Matrix or it's properties, so we don't consider the 0 vector as an eigenvector. It's part of the definition of what an eigenvector is.

In terms of it ""breaking math"", in a sense it's very much related to ""division by zero. If the eigenvalue for the eigenvector is unique, then any value of lambda satififes 

M*0 = lambda * 0 = 0

The non-zero eigenvector prevents this from occurring."
Why cannot an eigenvector be a zero vector?,"Important and useful fact: Eigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues are linearly independent.

This won't be true if you allow zero Eigenvectors 

This fact helps you to diagonalize a matrix for example."
Why cannot an eigenvector be a zero vector?,"Since we define eigenvalues to be values m for which *there exists a vector v…* such that Av = mv, if we allowed v to be the zero vector then every value would be an eigenvalue for every matrix A, which would make the concept of eigenvalues useless.

Also, I have to contradict some of the other commenters here: zero is *never* an eigenvector for any matrix, and the eigenspace associated to an eigenvalue m consists of the eigenvectors associated to m *along with the zero vector*.  That makes it a linear subspace."
Why cannot an eigenvector be a zero vector?,"We take it as part of the definition of an eigenvector is that it is nonzero.

The zero vector v satisfies Av=lv for any matrix A and scalar l, but it's convenient to exclude it from the definition of ""eigenvector"" both because it's a trivial solution to that equation and because it's an inconvenient case. For example, if you include it, there's no unique eigenvalue for the zero ""eigenvector."" You would need to qualify ""except zero"" for a lot of theorems about the properties of eigenvectors and eigenvalues."
Why cannot an eigenvector be a zero vector?,A way to see it is to think in terms of eigenspace rather than eigenvector. You want to compute Ker(A-λ). If its not empty you call λ a eigenvalue and any basis of this vector space 'the' eigenvectors. Of course they're not unique since there are many basis but they all generate the same ker(A-λ) and you can't have the 0 vector in a basis.
Why cannot an eigenvector be a zero vector?,"The only correct answer is: that's the definition. That's how math works. It's not that it can't, just that it isn't. 

The better question is: Why is that a good definition? The answer is: 0 would be annoying and useless. We already know 0 is always a solution to the eigenvalue equation, what would it add to point it out. Plus everything would be unintuitive: There are n+1 instead of n eigenvectors. And everything would have to say ""the eigenvectors \[except 0\] form a basis..."". Why would you want that? 

Same reason 1 is not prime. Choose useful definitions, be happy."
Why cannot an eigenvector be a zero vector?,"The other comments are correct but another way to look at it is that an eigenvector retains its direction after some transformation, but the zero vector doesn’t have any direction to retain so it can never be an eigenvector."
Why cannot an eigenvector be a zero vector?,"Just because it doesn't tell us much, and we wouldn't be able to refer to ""the eigenvalue"" of an eigenvector. Kind of like specifying that primes are not 1, including 1 would make a bunch of statements longer.

However the zero vector is still an element of the eigenspace for any scalar. You could say that it is in all eigenspaces though (by definition since linear subspaces contain the zero vector)."
Why cannot an eigenvector be a zero vector?,"I’m a little confused in the sense that I’m not sure what more to say other than that’s part of the definition.

If you want to make a definition that’s more general than the existing one (let’s say zeigenvector, where the non-zero part of the definition is excluded) you are free to do so.

Whether that’s a good idea is another question though. We make terms and give them definitions often because they denote something or an idea that is useful and comes up frequently that you want to save from writing out the long definition each time.

Zero trivially being a zeigenvector is not very useful and just annoying baggage when trying to make useful statements on the topic. And you’d naturally want to exclude the zero vector when doing so, which is probably why the definition does so from the beginning.

Though perhaps there are certain cases where it’s nice to have a term that is more general than eigenvector to save you from having to say “eigenvectors as well as the zero vector”. I can’t immediately come up with anything off the top of my head."
Why cannot an eigenvector be a zero vector?,"Eigenvectors are orthogonal vectors. \[0,0,0\] is not orthogonal to \[1,2,3\], nor can you cross them to find another eigenvector than spans the vector space. Eigenvalues can be 0."
Why cannot an eigenvector be a zero vector?,"Understand a matrix is just a linear transformation. Eigenvectors are lines that don't change direction after that transformation.

The reason a 0 vector doesn't count is because there's no direction to measure."
Why cannot an eigenvector be a zero vector?,"The zero vector is always mapped to itself by linear maps. 

It will never get stretched/transformed, so we cannot ""see"" the scaling influence of eigenvalues. That's the idea behind the definition that eigenvectors must be non-zero."

22/7 is a irrational number,"Like others, I'm hoping that you simply misheard him. But you indicated that he was questioned on it already. If it was merely a matter of him being misheard or even him misspeaking, his answer certainly wouldn't be that it's deeper than that. There's nothing deep about a number that's the ratio of 22 and 7, two unquestionable integers. 

I guess give him one more shot to clear it up in case it was a misunderstanding on top of a misunderstanding, but you may need to lodge a complaint. You're paying good money for a class where their faculty member flat-out contradicts the definition of rational numbers. That's a pretty foundational concept. 

As others stated, maybe he thinks all nonterminal decimals are irrational, but that's no excuse. Even the most basic of professors can tell you that many integer ratios have repeating decimals. That's not a simple mistake to make. 

And even worse. I fear that maybe--just maybe--this guy sincerely believes that π=22/7. And man, if that is the case, definitely run away from this man as fast as possible.

22/7 is a irrational number,"There's a lot of probably well-intended humour in this thread, which may be confusing to someone who's learning the area.

There are three key concepts that I think are relevant here (and forget about repeating vs non-repeating decimals, that's just a particular representation not anything fundamental).

Rational numbers: A number that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers. 22/7 is obviously rational. Your professor probably just misspoke.

Anything that is not rational is irrational, but there are two subtypes of irrational number, and the difference between them is important.

1. Algebraic numbers: A number that is the solution to a polynomial equation (which has rational numbers as coefficients) - e.g. sqrt(2) is irrational.

2. Transcendental numbers: Any number that is not rational or algebraic. For example pi and e are both transcendental.

Now, you might wonder - how many transcendental numbers are there? Many.

In fact, many more than the algebraic numbers. Want to know specifically what ""many more"" means in this context? Welcome to a fascinating question that can act as the gateway to some fascinating mathematics.

22/7 is a irrational number,"Have you tried talking to it? I have, and I can vouch for the irrationality of 22/7. It is so irrational it thinks that gif is pronounced gif. Of course, as any rational person would tell you, the correct pronunciation is always gif, and never, ever, ever- gif.

And once it put the second O in front of the first O in school. That was the last straw and I have avoided all interactions since."
22/7 is a irrational number,He was being either ironic or idiotic. 22/7 is an approximation used for pi and of course pi is irrational as fuck! But if he just write 22/7 well sorry Mr. Teacher that is in the definition of rational and is fucking trivial.
22/7 is a irrational number,"He thinks it is irrational because it is an approximation for π, which is irrational.  But 22/7 is absolutely not irrational."
22/7 is a irrational number,22/7 is rational. This is because it can be expressed as a RATIO of two integers. That's where we get the word RATIOnal from.

22/7 is a irrational number,"Wow, this is shocking...

It can be written as a fraction, ergo it is rational. 

The entire discussion on periodic/aperiodic non-terminating numbers is a discussion on what possible representations fractions have. But the definition is whether it can be represented by a fraction. 

Your professor got something very basic completely wrong. And there's nothing deep about it..."

22/7 is a irrational number,"I would assume he is jokingly referring to pi as 22/7, even though that’s just an approximation. 22/7 is definitely rational, irrational numbers as you correctly understand cannot be written as fractions of rational numbers (and this fact is often used to prove something is irrational in my experience). He might just also be wrong, it’s hard to say if you missed something in that he was joking or actually referring to pi or something, math wise you didn’t miss anything and you’re correct 22/7 is rational but maybe you were sort of speaking past each other and the misunderstanding was in what you were both saying and actually meant it’s hard to say. But yes 22/7 is indeed rational."

22/7 is a irrational number,"""An irrational number is **a real number that cannot be expressed as a ratio of integers**; for example, √2 is an irrational number. We cannot express any irrational number in the form of a ratio, such as p/q, where p and q are integers, q≠0"".  He is wrong about 22/7.  That said- 22/7 is an old approximation of PI- which is an irrational number.  What he should have said is that PI is an irrational number, and 22/7 is a close approximation of PI.  Don't be too hard on your teacher- I'm sure they are doing what they can.  As a student- learn what you can and move on."

22/7 is a irrational number,22/7 is rational. It’s a ratio. Of 22 to 7.
22/7 is a irrational number,"22/7 is one of the worse approximations for pi, which is irrational. But 22/7 is definitely rational, by definition. 22 and 7 are both integers, and rational numbers are defined as a ratio (faction) of integers. 

Either you misheard, or that professor needs to be fired."
22/7 is a irrational number,"Nope. You are totally right. The prof was either incorrect or grossly oversimplifying the matter. 

Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be accurately defined by a fraction or a repeating decimal. Hence the name “irrational,” as in *no ratio* (fractions are ratios, in a sense). 

It used to be that 22/7 was an approximation of the value of π. By the third decimal place it’s already off the mark, but for, let’s say, some engineering or physics problems it’s close enough for 2 decimals places of significant digits."
22/7 is a irrational number,"Being able to be written in the form a/b where both a and b are integers is literally the definition of a rational number, so that statement is a bit of a tough sell.


It is very close to being irrational though, as it is a good approximation of pi and there is interesting math behind that, but that's all there is to it."
22/7 is a irrational number,Maybe he was trying a joke based on 22/7 being a decent approximation of pi
22/7 is a irrational number,"That’s because 22/7 = pi. Therefore, 22/7 is also transcendental."
How do i solve this differential equation? Need help,"Hey, thats a differential equation of the form x\*y'+y\*P(x)=Q(x), a pretty common type.

Look up the idea of ""Integrating factor"" and how they are used to solve these equations."
Usefulness of the concept of basis orientation,"My favorite example comes from games. The orientation of the axes is not standardized at all among 3D programs, so when you try to move a 3D model over to a game engine, the model will often be lying on its side or face down. You need to know the orientation that the game engine uses so you can export the model correctly.

Why does u-substitution work?,"It's literally just the chain rule, but in reverse. The derivative of f(g(x)) is f'(g(x))g'(x), therefore the antiderivative of the latter is the former.

Why does u-substitution work?,"It's just the chain-rule in reverse, combined with FTC:

Why does u-substitution work?,It is the Chain Rule but backwards
Why does u-substitution work?,"The integral should not care how you choose variables. The function you are integrating changes, but you get the same result. So, you are free to choose variables as you like. In particular so it is easier."

If you need a certain pattern to perform the integration, and you can find a transformation that makes the problem fit that pattern, then what is your specific objection to using it?"
Why does u-substitution work?,Essentially what u sub is doing is reframing ie this is actually this problem in disguise. Ie it's the art of taking off masks or mustaches
A symbolic reframing of vector inversion using logarithms — useful or just neat?,"Vectors aren't just 2-dimensional.

This is already [very well-known](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane). Visualizing complex multiplication as rotation and scaling is *extremely* useful!

A symbolic reframing of vector inversion using logarithms — useful or just neat?,"I think you're re-discovering e^ix = cos x + i sin x. Looking at complex multiplication as rotation and vice-versa was a big part of standard complex analysis education for me so it's interesting that you weren't familiar with it already.

As for your applications, complex exponents are already used that way a lot. Any time complex numbers show up in physics it's usually to represent something circular or wave-like because complex numbers make it easy to work with phases and rotation. It is the reason quantum wave functions are complex."
Explain to me like I’m five: pre-algebra,"You may benefit from Kahn Academy, it's free to use and will explain what you're looking for in detail"
Explain to me like I’m five: pre-algebra,"You've been doing Algebra for a long time without knowing.

Area = Length × Width 

Algebra describes how to get an answer to a question. Someone wanted to find how big a room was. Then they figured out how to describe it. The description comes in the form of a formula. That's how you get Length × Width = Area. 

Now, this formula can be manipulated to describe other questions, too! 

Length = Area / Width

Width = Area / Length.

These equations look funky! But they work.

What I would recommend is to write out the formulas with just the variables, no numbers. Then prove to yourself that these equations work by plugging in numbers.

Area = Length × Width

Length = Area / Width

Area = 35, Width = 7, Length = L. Find L.

L = 35 / 7 

L = 5

35 = 7 × 5

Now, you can see the formula works!

Try to graph the rectangle. Put your x-axis and y-axis in increments of 1. Each corner of a triangle with be points in the graph. 

Point 1: (4, 5)
Point 2: (5, 2)
Point 3: (2,2) 
Point 4: (4,2)

Length would be 3 (from Point 4 to Point 1). Width would be 1 (from Point 3 to Point 2). This physically proves that Length × Width really equals area. You can also divide the rectangles diagonally and get two triangles! Try to play around with the graph and points and the formulas that you use in school.

Now, with pre-algebra, you may see a lot of graphs. You learn about slope. And a bunch of other weird things that just don't make sense. But just know that slope and graphs and what not describe an answer to a question. You have to figure out what the question is and what kind of an answer you need.

Try this:

Now, try to ""manipulate"" this question and try to graph a triangle.

a² + b² = c²

In other words, try to find what a² equals. Try to find out what b² equals.

In the graph, if you graph a right triangle, let the width be along the x-axis and the height along the y-axis. The hypotenuse will form a sloped line, and its slope is rise over run (b/a). 

More hints:

(0,0) as one corner

(x,0) as another point

(0,y) as the final point

The hypotenuse will form a diagonal line between (x,0) and (0,y), and its slope is rise/run = y/x.

Here's another practice problem:

Can you make a triangle where the hypotenuse has a slope of 1? 

Okay, conclusion:

Try to play around with equations. Move around the variables. And graph the shapes. Graph the equations. Just have fun and see what relationships you can make. Because at the end of the day, math is about answering questions and proving those questions.

And practice and practice and practice."

Total area computed by Riemann Sum divided by length of the curve in X axis gives the average value of the function,Did you have a question?
I am a bit confused about calculating limits in real analysis,Can you show your steps? You won’t get that inequality if you assume the limit is 0.

I'm Hella Confused...,"Did you transcribe this poorly when asking the question here? Perhaps you meant to say (-48-6√5)/59 ? (Always use explicit parens when transcribing divisions in plain text unless they are completely unambiguous.)

Notice that -((48-6√5)/59) is very different to ((-48-6√5)/59) not because the minus sign is inside or outside the numerator, but rather because it is inside or outside the (explicit or implicit) parens around the *subtraction*. -(a-b) is equal to (b-a), not to (-a-b)."

Why am I so weak at maths even though I try my best ?,"For most students, it’s a lack of a strong foundation. New knowledge is connected to previous knowledge. If you don’t have much previous knowledge to pull from or the previous knowledge is very weak then just as quickly as the new knowledge is learned it is forgotten."

I forgot everything in math,khan academy
I forgot everything in math,"I suggest checking out The Organic Chemistry Tutor on youtube if you need to (re)learn specific math content.

In the bigger picture, I found that I couldn't retain much math until the end of high school because they kept teaching it like pure math. For example, I remember solving the quadratic equation in middle school many times, but I don't think I understood why I should care about finding the roots of a quadratic. Math really started to click once I started needing tools to solve specific problems I ran into. If you're more applied like me, maybe ask for situations one might use that particular math?"
What should I take after Calc III,"It depends on what you want to do. Completing Calc 3 in what I'm assuming is high school (since you mentioned AP classes) is insane.

I think statistics is the most important math class that everyone should take. It comes up so often, and yet I'd bet that most American adults don't know what a mean, median, mode, and standard deviation are. Statistics are also very useful in science and engineering (e.g., quantum mechanics is basically fancy statistics). This should be easier than any calculus course.

Linear algebra is good for coding applications. I found it to be mechanically easy, but it can be difficult to conceptualize the meaning of things like dot products, determinants, or vector spaces. This is very useful for questions like ""how do I systematically solve many equations at once?"" Or ""how do I mess with the coordinates of an object to show that it turned?""

Differential equations is the next step after calculus. This is good for questions like ""how does temperature affect pressure?"" or ""how does the concentration of this chemical change as a reaction progresses?"" This is likely the most difficult class, but it should be a comparible difficulty to linear algebra. In fact, I took a class in college which was a combined Diff EQ and linear algebra class. I have not taken them individually.

All are very useful, but I think statistics is the most applicable."
What should I take after Calc III,"You have calc 3, linear algebra, and differential equations in your high school? Kudos to your school district, that's impressive. People vary on which one they recommend taking first, but I always recommend taking linear algebra before differential equations. Differential equations uses a lot of techniques from linear algebra that click a lot better imo when you already know linear algebra. That said, you don't really use calculus in a linear algebra course, but you obviously use it a lot in differential equations.

As for what they are and how difficult they are:

* **Linear Algebra:** remember how you learned how to solve ""systems of linear equations"" in elementary school, like ""x+y = 3, x-y = 5, solve for x and y""? It basically starts out with that. You learn how to describe those kinds of situations with matrices and vectors, and then you get into a bunch of complicated vector space stuff. It can be hard for people because it's typically taught in a proof-based way where you need to understand how to prove stuff is true, though idk if that's the case in a high school course. This is definitely one of *the* most important classes anyone learns for any math-based field.
* **Differential Equations:** Instead of solving systems of *linear* equations, you solve systems of *differential* equations, like ""if f(0) = 3 and f(x) = 2f'(x), what's f(x)?"" A lot of those same ideas from linear algebra can be applied here to solve these similar situations. The course isn't usually *conceptually* difficult, like linear algebra can be, but it is *a lot* of computation. This will probably be the most computationally-heavy courses you ever take.
* **Stats:** I believe AP stats doesn't get into explaining complicated stats, like describing normal distribution as an integral and such. It covers a lot of stats formulas and probability to find the odds of different events happening based on some observations of data. I don't believe they really explain the formulas much in AP stats since they can be difficult to prove, though I could be wrong about that since I never took it in high school.
* **Calc 3:** Most people find this class much easier than calc 2. It's very similar to calc 2 in the sense that all the integrals are solved the same ways, it's just *more* of them, basically. That said, calc 3 makes the jump from 2 dimensions to n dimensions, and *that* can be difficult for some students to grasp. It also leads to a lot of annoying problems that you don't run into with 2 dimensions. In terms of computation though, it's the same level as calc 2, just easier now that you know calc 2."

Why would it take 27 hours to reverse engineer a mean?,"ChatGPT and other large language models are [not designed for calculation](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/13nzixp/meta_dont_consult_chatgpt_for_math_dont_on_the/) and will frequently be /r/confidentlyincorrect in answering questions about mathematics; even if you subscribe to ChatGPT Plus and use its Wolfram|Alpha plugin, it's much better to go to [Wolfram|Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) directly.

Why would it take 27 hours to reverse engineer a mean?,"Why would there be 17 billion combinations? If each of 30 values is either included or not, there are 2^(30)≈1 billion combinations.

30 minutes seems a long time to process, but whatever.

1 billion times 30 minutes is about 61,000 years, so you're not going to get very far with that approach."
Why would it take 27 hours to reverse engineer a mean?,"There are some problems that are (to the best of our knowledge) not possible to solve better than doing an exponential brute force search, in the worst case. These problems are called NP-hard. One of these is, given a set of large numbers, find a subset of these numbers that sums to a given large number k.

When faced with an NP hard problem, your best bet is to try to solve a different problem instead. If you can't, the next best thing is to find someone who has a PhD in one of the methods for solving hard problems, and who did a postdoc in one of the other ways of solving hard problems, because then they might know more than one way that might work. You must also absolutely stay away from people who have done a little bit of CS theory, because they know just enough to lead you astray.

Your get-out in this case might be that subset sum is only hard (both theoretically and empirically) if the numbers are big. I would suggest bribing a CS PhD student who knows how to implement dynamic programming algorithms efficiently."
Why would it take 27 hours to reverse engineer a mean?,"I'm not sure I understand completely, but if you have 30 scores then there are (only) 2^(30) = 1073741824 or a little over 1 billion possible subsets.  If you only want subsets of size 2 through 30 then you would eliminate 31 of those 1 billion possibilities, which is negligible.

It wouldn't take any noticible time to compute the average of one of those sets and compare that average to your subscale score.  On my rather crappy pc it's analyzing about 1 million subsets in 3 seconds.  So to do all of them would take about 3000 seconds or 50 minutes."
Books or Articles about Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem,Started some great books on this but... Never finished
Books or Articles about Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem,"I liked Gödel, Escher, Bach by Hofstadter

Edit: typo"
Books or Articles about Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem,"There is a fully detailed proof in most any introductory textbook on mathematical logic. Examples:

Mendelson - Introduction to Mathematical Logic

Kleene - Introduction to Metamathematics (classic; old; not enough model theory so not a good first book of logic these days)

Some undergrad level books have mostly-complete abbreviated proofs where you can still get the idea but certain details (say strong representability of primitive recursive functions in PA) are left out. Example:

Ebbinghaus, Flum, and Thomas - Mathematical Logic

A lot of undergrad courses nowadays seem to cover not the original proof but a newer one based on Turing machines or some other model of the principles of recursion/computability theory (based on ideas of e.g. Chaitin, Boolos, etc., or something similar). This is because you can rephrase the first incompleteness theorem as a statement about algorithms, that it's impossible to construct a certain kind of algorithm, and today's students find algorithms much easier to think about than they used to. An example can be found in, e.g.,

Boolos - Logic, Logic, and Logic

Here I should point out that the Godel Incompleteness Theorem is actually two theorems, the First and Second Incompleteness Theorems:

First Incompleteness Theorem: There exist sentences 𝜙 of the language of first order Peano arithmetic such that the axioms of first order Peano arithmetic neither prove 𝜙 nor prove ¬𝜙 (that is, 𝜙 is *independent* of the axioms of this theory).

Second Incompleteness Theorem: Let Con(PA) be the sentence of first order PA that expresses (codes) the assertion that first order PA is consistent. Then Con(PA) has the property of 𝜙 in the First Incompleteness Theorem."

where is the mistake here?,"f(x) = Log_{1/2} (x)

Since ln(x) is increasing and ln(2) >0, the function f(x) is decreasing. This means that we must reverse the direction of an inequality when we apply it to both sides:

a < b implies f(a) > f(b)."
where is the mistake here?,not every function is increasing.
where is the mistake here?,"log\_0.5(x) = - log\_2(x) is a decreasing function. You can prove that equality using the change of base formula, log\_0.5(x) = log\_2(x) / log\_2(0.5) = - log\_2(x), since log\_2(2\^(-1)) = -1.

For a decreasing function f(x), if a < b, then f(a) > f(b). So the inequality is wrong when you take the log\_0.5 of both sides.

Why do textbooks teach finding the VA before the hole in rational functions?,"I would bet it isn't meant to be indicating the order you do the question, which I agree could be confusing, but also students should be able to manage the best order, hopefully the instructor guided them in this. I can definitely imagine that there was no thought put into this, it wasn't put in this order on purpose. I have certainly not noticed this trend in textbooks.

Definitely agree that you pull the hole out first THEN look for intercepts and asymptotes."
Why do textbooks teach finding the VA before the hole in rational functions?,"I usually tell students that finding the domain, vertical asymptotes, holes, and x-intercepts of rational functions is a single process.

Find all integer solutions to x³ + x² + x = y² + y,"For x = 0 we get the two solutions that you've found. 

For x < 0 the LHS is negative, but the RHS is nonnegative, so no solutions there. 

For x > 0 we get

x^3 = y^2 - x^2 + y - x = (y - x)(x + y + 1).

If a prime p divides both y - x and x + y + 1 then it also divides their difference 2x + 1. On the other hand

p | x^3 ⇒ p | x,

in contradiction to p | 2x + 1. Hence y - x and x + y + 1 are coprime and must themselves be cubes:

why use -n cos instead of sin??,"It depends on where you start and which point on the ferris wheel you ""track"". Negative cosine means starting at -1 which would for example match your position (relative to the center) when you start a ride getting into the wheel at the bottom. If you instead enter the wheel ""along the equator"" a sin or -sin might be a better fit for example."
why use -n cos instead of sin??,"You get on a ferris wheel at the bottom, so you want the trig function that starts at the lowest point. That's negative cosine."
why use -n cos instead of sin??,its just down to preference really
why use -n cos instead of sin??,if you take the derivative of sin it will give you cos . and then you take the derivative the cos it will give you - sin ( negative sin)  to observe the change of a function sin we take the -cos because in your case -n cos is the change of sin
why use -n cos instead of sin??,"If you start at sine, you will be beginning at the principal axis (i.e. max height+min height divided by 2). That would give you a height at the midway of the ferris wheel. Therefore, by using a negative cosine, you are starting at the minimum possible value of cosine (Just observe the graph of negative cosine. When x=0, cosine is at a negative minimum). 

Furthermore, if you really prefer using sine function, you could do a horizontal translation of pi/2 in the negative x-axis direction (i.e. sin(x+pi/2)) to achieve the same thing."
why use -n cos instead of sin??,"Yes, if starting at the 3 o'clock position it's usually easier to use sine. Most other times, though, cosine is easier. I prefer using cosine the majority of the time because the phase shift is usually easier to find."

"Found an interesting discontinuity problem, yet I can't understand its solution - can someone help?","You say that you understand the idea, so what is the idea, and how did you try to apply it? Where did you get stuck? What answer did you get?

The reason that 2 is the answer is because x = 2 is the only point where the function is not continuous.  
  
Is the problem that you ran into that you didn't get that x = 2 is a point where the function is discontinuous? Or did you get other values too, and that was the problem?

What would it mean for the function to be continuous at x = 2? Why does that fail in this case? What about other values of x?"
"Found an interesting discontinuity problem, yet I can't understand its solution - can someone help?","The floor function changes value at every integer, so you should split the interval [0, 2] into [0, 1), [1,2) and {2}. Then the only possible discontinuities can occur at x = 1 and x = 2."
"Found an interesting discontinuity problem, yet I can't understand its solution - can someone help?","Here's how I approached it:

x - floor(x) is basically just all the numbers from 0 to 1, repeated at every integer, like [this](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ktxmxhaxui). You don't have to know what this graph looks like, just that it's discontinuous at integers. The numerator has x - floor(x) and the denominator has 2x - floor(x) + 1 = x + (x - floor(x)) + 1, so we can expect it to have these same discontinuities of integers. However, the numerator is (x - floor(x))(x - 1), so when x=1, (x-1) = 0, which gets rid of the x-floor(x) jump at x=1. We should also make sure we don't have any asymptote problems with the denominator, but this is going to be a negative number since 2x - floor(x) ≈ x and x+1 gives an asymptote of x=-1. So the only discontinuities on \[0,2\] are going to be x=0 and x=2. 0+2 = 2, so the answer is S=2."
"Found an interesting discontinuity problem, yet I can't understand its solution - can someone help?","Untangle the cases:

              \                0,   2  = x

Note ""f"" is continuous everywhere except for possibly ""x in {1; 2}"" as a composition of continuous functions. Consider the exceptions manually, start with ""x = 1"":

How does d/dx(y^2) become 2y * dy/dx?,y is a function of x so you can think of this as finding the derivative of f(x)^2 so you start by finding the derivative of the outer function (2f(x)) and then the inner derivative. In this case it becomes 2y times the derivative of y with respect to x.

Book recommendations to learn calculus(only integration part),"'Learning integration properly' is a bit ambiguous, since you usually learn it once for applications, then if you study mathematics you repeatedly relearn it at various levels of abstraction.

Larson, Stewart, and Rogawski all have excellent introductory textbooks. Spivak, Lang, and Folland have texts that are more rigorous and perhaps more 'proper', but they largely assume you've seen some calculus before.

Before studying integration though, I *highly* recommend you review your algebra. Mastering algebra is a much more efficient use of time than starting integration, and it can be difficult for young people to recognize their level of mastery.

But if you feel all the problems in your algebra resources are easy to solve, give the Larson book a try."
How do we do this process in the other direction? (explanation in the description),"In this specific example I would notice the fact that 3=2+1=√2^(2)+1^2 and 2√2=2\*1\*√2 so we have a^(2)+2ab+b^2 which is (a+b)^2.
In general, if I see a square root I will see what happens if I subtract its square from the constant.
Edit: A general formula for the square of a+b√c is a^(2)+b^(2)c+2ab√c.At this point you can treat this as a system of equations (probably best to start by rewriting the ab equation)."
How do we do this process in the other direction? (explanation in the description),"Yeah, you can just reverse the process.


Suppose we have a number of the form:


A + B√C


Squaring and taking the root gives us a number of the form:


√((A^2 + B^(2)C) + 2AB√C)


Since we know C, if we have a number in the latter form we can set up a system of equations to solve for A and B. To use your example:


A^2 + 62B^2 = 230951


2AB = 14514


I'm not going to write out solving it, but the two non-negative solutions are your original values of A = 123, B = 59 and A = 59√62, B = 123/√62 (which is the same solution with the order of elements reversed)."
How do we do this process in the other direction? (explanation in the description),"Suppose (√a + √b)²=3+2√2 where a and b are rational numbers. Expanding the left side gives you a+b+2√(ab). Since rational numbers are closed under addition and multiplication, a+b=3 and ab=2. Now you can figure out a and b. Note that this doesn't work with every number"
How do we do this process in the other direction? (explanation in the description),"Given ""a; b in Z"" you want to find ""x; y in Z"" s.th.

    a + b√c  =  x^2 + cy^2 + 2xy√c    <=>    (b-2xy)√c  =  x^2 + cy^2 - a

If ""b-2xy != 0"", we could solve for ""√c = rational"" -- a contradiction to ""√c"" being irrational. Thus, both sides must vanish, and we have both ""b = 2xy"" and ""x^2 + cy^2 - a = 0"". Multiply by x^2 to get

how to simplify radicals,"Same way, just with a couple tricks. Look up ""divisibility rules"" for tips on quick division checks. 

For 9,095,625? Let's do it..

First: it ends in 625, so that's a factor of 5⁴ right away. 

14,553

Sum of the digits is 18, so this is divisible by 9. 

1,617 is still divisible by 3 again. 

539 

This number looks funny, so Imma try a few of the odder divisibility rules. 53 - 2(9) = 35 = 7(5), so we're divisible by 7. That leaves us with 77 = 11(7) as factors as well

Thus √9,095,625 = √(5⁴ × 3³ × 7² × 11) = 525√33

Now because I'm going for all the cookies, what's that number? Time for the tricky part: the actual root computation. Since 33 = 5² + 8, we can use algebra to get the following:

33 - 5² = 8 = (√33-5)(√33+5)

√33 = 5 + 8/(5 + √33)

√33 = 5 + 8/(10 + 8/(10 + 8/(10 + 8/(5 + ...)))) 

The more iterations we do the better the approximation, but I ain't sitting at my computer all night. Where do we cut it off? Since 5 < √33 < 6 let's say √33 ≈ 6. That way we can approximate: 

√33 ≈ 5 + 8/(10 + 8/(10 + 8/(10 + 8/(5+6)))) 

√33 ≈ 5 + 8/(10 + 8/(10 + 88/118)) 

√33 ≈ 5 + 8/(10 + 4(59)/317)

√33 ≈ 5 + 4(317)/1703

√33 ≈ 9783/1703 ≈ 5.76icouldntbedamnedtodomoredivision

Multiplying that by our 525 gives us about 3024-ish. It's likely overshooting a bit, but good enough for a by hand calculation. Calculator says 3015, so not too far off.

how to simplify radicals,"Find squares that divide into it. For example, your number ends in 25 so it's divisible by 25. Then you'll have 5*sqrt(x), where x is whatever 9095625/25 is. Repeat this process until you can't anymore.

I'd start with 4 and work my way up the squares unless you see something else immediately. If it ends in any even number besides 0 or 2, you can divide by 2 twice, therefore it's divisible by 4. If not, try dividing by 9."
how to simplify radicals,"You didn't ask this, but if you want to *approximate* a root, there are other neat tricks.

[Mathematical Economics] How do I factor out functions more consistently?,"The equation `-3Q^2 - 10Q + 2850 = 0` doesn't have rational roots and therefore can't really be factored by hand.

[Mathematical Economics] How do I factor out functions more consistently?,">π'(Q) = -6(Q+30)(Q-20) = 0 (This is where I get lost, tbh)

This is simply a matter of finding two numbers that add to 10 and multiply to -600. Because -600 is negative, that means the numbers multiplying to -600 are one positive and one negative, thus you can think of the ""add to 10"" part as ""their absolute values have a difference of 10"".

So, you start thinking of factors of 600... 10 x 60? 10 and 60 are too far apart to have a difference of 10, you need numbers that are closer together. How about 20 x 30? 20 and 30 have a difference of 10. Because they need to ""add to 10"", which is positive, you just make the smaller one (20) negative. Thus, 30 x -20 = -600, and 30 + (-20) = 10. Then you simply put those two numbers into two factors: (Q + 30)(Q - 20).

>π(Q) = -Q^3 - 10Q^2 + 2850Q - 600

>π'(Q) = -3Q^2 - 10Q + 2850 = 0    (This is the one I need to factor out.)

This is the wrong derivative. It should be π'(Q) = -3Q^2 - 20Q + 2850 = 0. But either way, this is not factorable. The best approach to solve this would be the quadratic formula.

>AC'(Q) = 2Q - 6 - 600/Q^2 = 0

Again, not factorable...but there's also no formula for this. When I have a computer solve this for me, the solution appears so complicated that it almost seems like it doesn't belong in the same class as the first two problems."
[Mathematical Economics] How do I factor out functions more consistently?,"Use the quadratic formula to find the zeroes (second term should be ""-20Q""). No guessing, it always works -- even for irrational or complex-valued roots. In your example:

    <=>    Q_12  =  -5/3 ± √(10^2 + 9*950)/3  =  (-5 ± 5√346) / 3

When two numbers are divided, they are proportional to each other, or in ratio with each other. Therefore, you can work with the numerator and denominator as if they are in an equation: for it to remain true and proportional, if you perform an operation on the numerator, you have to perform the same operation on the denominator.

In this instance, because we have a fraction being divided by a fraction, it looks messy, and unintuitive, so we try to turn the denominator (bottom of fraction) into a ""1"", because that is an identity property, so anything divided by 1 will remain itself. Once the denominator is turned into 1, we don't have to worry about it anymore, so we don't have to write it, because its presence is always assumed. That will make our initial problem look neater and easier to work with.

So, what do we multiply a fraction with to turn it into 1? We use its reciprocal (the fraction turned upside down) so that everything cancels, and 1 remains. Remember though, since we're treating this like a ratio or equation, we need to apply the operation to both sides. We multiply the denominator with its reciprocal in order to turn it into 1, and then we also multiply the numerator with the denominator's reciprocal.

This way, it appears as if though the ÷(2/3) turns into a ×(3/2).

With the denominator now turned into 1, we can ""throw it away"", and focus on the numerator, which now looks like a conventional product of two fractions, which you can simplify as you normally would: Factor if possible, then multiply the tops, and multiply the bottoms.

The reason this is works is similarity / proportionality. Even though we manipulated the problem, since the same operations were applied on both sides, it will simplify to the same fraction, in the same way that (8/10)=(4/5)."
How does fraction division actually work?,"Because division is the opposite of multiplication? 


Do you agree that multiplying by 1/7 is the same as dividing by 7?"
How does fraction division actually work?,"A **third** fits 3 times into a **whole**

    1 / ⅓  =  3

So a third would fit **7× more** into **seven wholes**

    7 / ⅓  =  7 × 3

If you **double** the size to ⅔, you can only fit **half** as many

    7 / ⅔  =  7 × 3/2

You can repeat this process for any nonzero numerator and denominator.

**1/d** fits d times into a **whole**

    1 / (1/d)  =  d

So it would fit **A× more** into **A wholes** >!hehe!<

    A / (1/d)  =  A × d

If you increase it size **n-fold** to n/d, you can only fit **1/n** as many

    A / (n/d)  =  A × d/n"

How does fraction division actually work?,"I think there’s a couple different ways to get there. The simplest, in my opinion, is to think about addition and subtraction.

If I take 3 - (-2), I feel it’s pretty comfortable to say that this equals 3 + 2 = 5. This is a consequence of the fact that subtraction is what we call the inverse of addition.

If you are comfortable with that, then know that by definition, division is the inverse of multiplication, and know that all a fraction is, is a division symbol between two numbers. So like 3 - (-2) = 3 + 2, you can also say that 3 / (1 / 2) = 3 * 2.

Going any deeper than that requires getting into what it means for two operations to be inverses of each other… which is, I think, a bit beyond the scope of the question. Though feel free to ask more about it. Hope this helps!"

How does fraction division actually work?,"Rethink division as an ""application of an area"". For example, 10 ÷ 5 = 2. Take a rectangular area of 10, reshape it so it sits on a base of 5 units of length, and its resultant height will be 2 units of length. Or 10 ÷ 2 = 5, take an area of 10 units and reshape it to sit on a base of 2, and its height with be 5. Now take an area of 1/2. Apply it to a line of 2/3, and its height will be 3/4.

At this point think back over what division is, the undoing or inverse of multiplication. 3/4 × 2/3 = 1/2, and you can model that with a rectangle whose sides are 3/4 and 2/3.

Maybe at this point the reason why ""invert and multiply"" is the trick to dividing fractions will jump out at you."
How does fraction division actually work?,"The fraction 1/7 is actually the division of 1 by 7. They're the same things using different notations. In the same way, 10/7 is the division of 10 by 7, and multiplying a fraction by a number is the same as multiplying the numerator by the number.

In the same way, dividing 1/7 by 1/2 is the same as multiplying 1/7 by 1/1/2. 1/1/2 is notationally the same as 2/1.

It's easy to see that in whole number division.

10/5 is the same as llllllllll/lllll which is the instruction to group everything in the numerator by the number in the denominator.... lllll. lllll and then count the groups (there are two). 10/5=2. Since any fraction with the same number in the numerator and the denominator is the same as one....5/5=1, then multiplying by 2 should result in two and so it does. That's why multiplying a fraction by a number is the same as multiplying the numerator by the number.

As with most languages, there are usually multiple ways of ""saying"" things in math. Fluency in being able to translate is something I've tried to instill in my students that doesn't seem to be taught in traditional classes."
How does fraction division actually work?, A fraction means “divided by” (2/3)/ (1/3) is literally 2/3  divided by 1/3 then you flip 2/3 x 3/1
How does fraction division actually work?,"The reciprocal of a rational number is the multiplicative inverse of said rational number.

If you have p/q, then multiplying by 1/q to numerator and denominator gives you p(1/q)/(q(1/q)) = p(1/q)/1 = p(1/q). As should be obvious, this p(1/q) is the same as the p/q you started with.

The way we define multiplication of (representations of) rational numbers is by multiplying their respective numerators and denominators. 

(a/b)\*(c/d) = (ac)/(bd). 

What it *means* to divide by a rational number is to multiply by its reciprocal, i.e. we define p/q as p\*q^(-1) = p\*(1/q). 

(a/b)/(c/d) = (a/b)\*(c/d)^(-1) = (a/b)\*(d/c) = (ad)/(bc).

Again, the reason division works this way is because the reciprocal is the number that multiplies the given number to give you 1. 

(1/q)\*q = q\*(1/q) = 1, and p = p\*1 = p\*(1/q)\*q, so p/q *should be* 

p = (p/q)\*q = (p\*(1/q))\*q

Cancel the q's: 

p/q = p\*(1/q)

Edit: Clarified what I was showing with the factorization."

Through that you were able to construct two new irrationals out of one. Now you can repeat this step, but each time changing the interval (a,b) to (a,i_1) and (i_1,b). 
With this you can always produce at least one irrational number with each partition of the numbers. Considering how since there is an uncountable amount of real numbers(that is, an uncountable amount of possible partitions), this implies that there would also be an uncountable amount of irrationals between any two distinct rational numbers.

Can the 'Area' and 'Circumference' of a Circle be equal and unequal at the same time?,">π(r\^2) = π(6\^2) = 36π feet

This is wrong. It should be:

π(r\^2) = π((6 feet)\^2) = 36π feet\^2"
Can the 'Area' and 'Circumference' of a Circle be equal and unequal at the same time?,Look into [dimensional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis). A length can never be equal to an area. An area can never be equal to a mass. A mass can never be equal to a speed. Etc.
Can the 'Area' and 'Circumference' of a Circle be equal and unequal at the same time?,"A never equals C because the units of A and C are different. Considering just the numbers, whether A is larger, equal or smaller than C is down to the choice of units. You're right that the choice of units does not change anything physical about the circle, but you're wrong to assume that the relative sizes of the numbers A and C is a physical property of the circle."
Can the 'Area' and 'Circumference' of a Circle be equal and unequal at the same time?,"if you are working with any units at all then they are never equal because 4π yards is not the same as 4π yards^(2).

in pure math though, there are no units, so the area and circumference of a circle of radius 2 are both 4π so they are equal."
Can the 'Area' and 'Circumference' of a Circle be equal and unequal at the same time?,"This is like saying there is a blue square and a blue circle. Since they're both blue, they must be the same?

Areas are usually dimensioned in square-something. ft\^2 or m\^2

Lengths are usually dimensioned in linear something. ft or m.

ft and ft\^2 are NOT the same thing. So you can't just ""take the number"" and call it equal. If that were true then since 1 ft = 12 inches therefore 1 = 12."
Can the 'Area' and 'Circumference' of a Circle be equal and unequal at the same time?,">but can these values be both equal and unequal in a given circle?

What are you even trying to ask? Equal and unequal are mutually exclusive categories: if two numbers are equal, they cannot by definition be unequal and vice versa."
Can the 'Area' and 'Circumference' of a Circle be equal and unequal at the same time?,"Area units are different than length units. You measure are in square feet or square yards. Length in feet or yards. 1 square yard is 9 square feet (not 3). Think about a 1 yard x 1 yard square. Each side is 3 feet. The whole thing is 9 1 foot x 1 foot squares. 

Because of this, when you convert length from feet to yards, you divide by 3, but when you convert area from square feet to square yards, you divide by 9. All of your calculations are accurate - the numerical equality of area and circumference is dependent on the units used. 

If you consider what it takes to have A=C, you get πr^2 = 2πr, which solves to give r=2. This means if you choose your units such that the radius of a circle is 2, the area (in those units) will always have the same numerical value as the circumference. 

Note that due to having different units, this doesn’t really mean anything. Area and circumference aren’t equal, but they also aren’t unequal. They aren’t able to be compared like that. It’s kind of like asking to multiply an apple by an orange. Just doesn’t make sense to try to do - and even if you find a way, the results won’t mean anything. "
Can the 'Area' and 'Circumference' of a Circle be equal and unequal at the same time?,"Area isn’t measured in “feet” it’s measured in square feet.

There is a solution to the equation pi*2*r=pi*r^2  if that’s what you’re asking though."
Can the 'Area' and 'Circumference' of a Circle be equal and unequal at the same time?,"A = C

πr^(2) = 2πr

r^(2) = 2r

r = 0; r = 2

Can the 'Area' and 'Circumference' of a Circle be equal and unequal at the same time?,"Choose a different unit for length. If the numerical value in imperial units is equal, it may not be in SI-units, and vice versa. Having a same numerical value only applies to specific units, not in general.

Even better -- do *not* drop units during calculation in the first place."
Can the 'Area' and 'Circumference' of a Circle be equal and unequal at the same time?,"Equal if pi\*r^(2) = 2pi\*r. Solving for r you get either 0 or 2, the former being not a particularly interesting circle. 

Unequal because the units on area and the units on length are different. So while your area may be 4pi and your circumference will be 4pi, one will be in square inches/feet/meters/furlongs,… while the other will be in simply inches/feet/meters/furlongs,…."
Can the 'Area' and 'Circumference' of a Circle be equal and unequal at the same time?,"You could also decide to create the equation, pi r^2 = 2pi r, and solve for r. This would give you a set of values of r for which the area and circumference of the circle have the same numerical value using the same base unit. Now, whether this property is actually useful... tbd."
Can the 'Area' and 'Circumference' of a Circle be equal and unequal at the same time?,"A circle with radius 6 feet has an area of A(feet) = pi*(6 feet)^2 = pi*36 feet^2, or approximately 113.1 feet^2 or square feet. The same circle has circumference of C(feet) = 2*pi*(6 feet) = 12*pi feet, or approximately 37.7 feet. Notice that the units are different. The ratio of area to circumference is A(feet)/C(feet) = (pi*36 feet^2 )/(12*pi feet) = 3 feet.

Now do the same in yards. 6 feet is 2 yards.  A circle with radius 2 yards has an area of A(yards) = pi*(2 yards)^2 = pi*4 yards^2, or approximately 12.6 yards^2 or square yards. The same circle has circumference of C(yards) = 2*pi*(2 yards) = 4*pi feet, or approximately 12.6 yards. Notice that the units are different. The ratio of area to circumference is A(yards)/C(yards) = (pi*4 yards^2 )/(4*pi yards) = 1 yard.

In both cases, note that the unit of the ratio is the same as the unit used to measure the radius. Further, notice that the ratio in both cases is equal to one half of the radius, with the correct units. Finally, notice that the ratios are actually equal to one another: 3 feet equals 1 yard. So, the units do matter, in the sense that without them it can be difficult to interpret the results. But they also don’t matter, in the sense that the math is always the same. It doesn’t matter what units you use, or at what step during a problem at which you switch from one unit to another. As someone else said, look into “dimensional analysis”; it can be very helpful when trying to solve certain types of problems. 

(And to tie it all up in a bow. In a unitless world, area of a circle is A = pi*r^2 and circumference is C =2*pi*r. The ratio of the two is A/C = (pi*r^2 )/(2*pi*r) = r/2. So the ratio is always equal to half the radius. If r has units, then they will appear naturally in the calculation. If r = 2 for any type of unit, then the ratio will be 1 unit and the area and circumference will be “equal” but only in tue case where the are no units.)"
Can the 'Area' and 'Circumference' of a Circle be equal and unequal at the same time?,Tracking units kept me out of trouble during my university years and would sometimes clear up misunderstandings like momentum and kinetic energy not being the same.
Can the 'Area' and 'Circumference' of a Circle be equal and unequal at the same time?,"2pi\*r = pi\*r^2  if you solve for r, the pis cancel out and you get r=2 so let's plug that in:  

circumference: 2pi\*(2) = 4pi  

Area: pi\*(2)^2 = 4pi  

You can have both numerically equal at the same time but only at r = 2. But they will never be truly equal since they will have different dimensions."
Can the 'Area' and 'Circumference' of a Circle be equal and unequal at the same time?,"It depends what you mean.  6 apples and 6 oranges are two different (so, not ""equal"") collections of objects.  

However, the collections have the same size.  Anything you could do with the six apples (that doesn't interact with what an apple is or change the apples in any way) you could do with the oranges in the same way.  You can reorder them, stack them, count them, add or remove one, etc., and the result would be the same in either case (just in terms of apples or oranges, respectively).

Sometimes, you care about the context of a number, including what it may be measuring.  In those cases, the quantity of objects and what those objects are have to be the same (or an equivalent, like 1 ft versus 12 in) to be talking about the same thing.  

Other times, you're working more with numbers (or algebra, etc.) for numbers' sake, and care only about whether the sizes are the same, regardless of what they count, because the mathematical properties work the same way regardless.

As a rough rule of thumb for things like school, if a question gives units, keep track of them and give them in your answer.  If not, you can if it's helpful, but probably don't have to unless your instructor says otherwise.

--------

This part is less for OP and more an interesting example of OP's dilemma that comes up when teaching Calc classes.

While they don't have to be understood this way, double integrals are often first introduced as a way of finding (net) volume under a surface and above the  xy-plane (give or take variable name choices).  Then, a theorem is usually given, noting that taking the double integral of the constant function 1 (or equivalently, just the area differential by itself) over a region gives the area of that region.

This often causes some confusion in students, because now you get area instead of volume all of a sudden.  One way to explain it is to reframe the scenario as the function as giving weightings or density or the like rather than a third spacial dimension, but I find it often tracks better to note (with a drawing)  that you're finding the volume of a prism with height 1, which is numerically always the same as the area of the base.  Different dimension and different units, if those are being tracked, sure, but it finds the right measurement.

It just seemed like a neat example of how this same question and intuition shows up at various stages of learning.

(And yeah, one perspective on the integral thing that can help resolve it is measure theory, but that's well beyond the scope of a first treatment of double integrals.)"
Can the 'Area' and 'Circumference' of a Circle be equal and unequal at the same time?,"Your choice of units doesn't change anything about the physical circle, that's true.

Units can be thought of as placeholders for additional math that you have to do. You can work through a problem using feet on one side and yards on the other, but to actually decide if the answers are the same, you need to take care of the units math.

It is valid to work through the problem without units, but if that's what you want to do, then you need to do that from the very first step. That means you can no longer say that the circle has a radius of 6 *feet*, you can only say that it has a radius of 6. Your substitution, then, would not be with a radius of 2 *yards*, but merely with a radius of 2. Since 6 does not equal 2, you would not expect A to equal C.

What you're trying to do is start with units and then ignore the required units math at the end. You're not allowed to do that, which is why you get an answer that doesn't make sense."
Can the 'Area' and 'Circumference' of a Circle be equal and unequal at the same time?,"So your units for area should be square feet or square inches.

But there IS something fun here: try showing that if you get to choose your unit (cm, in, ft, yard, something else) that EVERY circle has a unique unit where the area and circumference are equal values in the unit\^2 and unit."
Is my graph correct?,"Looks like it's off by one and flipped (transposed).  Although transposition is just a convention.

If A (1) goes to C (2) then you want row 1 column 3 to be a 1.  But you could do it as column 1 row 3 to be a 1 (transposed) and nobody would know the difference as long as you interpret it that way.  What you have is column 1 row 4 as a 1 for this.

Compsci will often use a row/column 0 instead of 1 for the 0th (ordinal).  That can cause the off-by-one. Some graphs therefore have a 0 vertex.  Just gotta make sure your columns and rows line up with their intended vertex.

Building these graphs can be tedious (it's just data entry) but they're absurdly powerful once you've got em. Don't give up!"
Product of two positive definite symmetric matrices,"what do you mean it feels wrong, most matrices just don't commute regardless of symmetry, not sure what are you looking for. Just write out the product of two 2x2 symmetric matrices and see there is no reason for the off diagonal term to be the same"
Can some break this down so it’s easily understood,All of these are incorrect because H and K may be either different (which means one is greater/lower than the other) or both are zero.
Can some break this down so it’s easily understood,"You can rewrite it as H = -3K. K can be any number. If K is positive, then H is negative and therefore smaller than K. But if K is negative, H is positive and therefore larger than K. If K = 0 then H = 0 also. So all cases H < K, H = K, H > K are possible.

Alternatively: the difference H - K is (-3K) - K = -4K. This difference can be negative, zero or positive depending on what K is."
Can some break this down so it’s easily understood,"None are correct. Counter-examples:

Why a constant of integration in first order linear differential equations?,"The constant of integration is, indeed, included.

But it is safe to assume that it is zero.

Imagine if it were some constant c

Then, the positive factor e\^c can be cancelled from both sides of the equation.

In other words, the constant has no effect on the solution of the differential equation."

All I'm saying is, be flexible on the learning style.

For you if you're hitting a wall in pre-calc then do what everyone else has to do - go back until you're rock-solid and then build up from there.

How to solve this type of combination problem?,This is called 5 choose 3. There is a formula for combinations. You are correct that 5 choose 3 is 10.
How to solve this type of combination problem?,"There are 5! = 120 ways to arrange five distinct objects. If they are not all distinct, the number drops. If there's three of one kind and two of another, you can divide by 3! = 6, and by 2! = 2, in either order, to get 120/(6\*2) = 120/12 = **10**.

How does this apply here? Well, you can think of the five objects as (say) checkers: three red and two black, on the five pictures of the items. You order the three, and reject the two. There is no difference except form, so the answer is the same. QED."
How to solve this type of combination problem?,"If it doesn't matter what the order of your choice is, you use combinations.  If the order does matter, then you use permutations.

This is a combination since it doesn't matter what order your 3 items are in.

Basically what you do is you say you can choose 5 items for the first item, 4 for the second, and 3 for the third, so you can choose 5\*4\*3 items.  You can write that as 5!/2!.

But because you don't care about order, and you're counting each set of items multiple times, you have to divide it by the number of ways each set can be ordered, which is 3! ways (3\*2\*1), so your final answer is 5!/(2!3!)."
Re-Learning for Calculus,"Math professor here. I suggest pairing low-cost calculus books written for students with YouTube video lectures. Good options for the books include: Calculus for Dummies, Schaum's Outlines, and my own book, Calculus Simplified ([https://sites.google.com/view/fernandezmath/books](https://sites.google.com/view/fernandezmath/books)). Note that I said ""written for students."" That's because most calculus textbooks are written for the instructors, who then distill the content into about 30 hour-long lessons. The books I just mentioned are written with students in mind, aiming to explain concepts in more accessible ways. As for the YouTube videos, I recommend Krista King Math, Professor Leonard, and, for shorter videos, my own ([https://www.youtube.com/@fernandezmath](https://www.youtube.com/@fernandezmath)). 

TL;DR: Pair resources written for students (which are by design more intuitive, digestible, and faster to go through) with short videos on content. Don't re-learn everything; going through the resources I mentioned will naturally surface your knowledge gaps and help you develop a plan to fill them."

What are the 2 inverse operations of logarithms?,"Well we're talking about a two argument logarithm, f(a,b)=log_a(b). It we fix a and look for an inverse, we get the function a\^x. But if we fix b and look for an inverse, then we have to solve log_a(b)=x for a.
b=a^x, a=b\^1/x. So the other inverse of the log is the xth root of a fixed argument."
What are the 2 inverse operations of logarithms?,"If x^y = z, then y = log_x(z).

Galois Theory Humbled Me,"I went to grad school in algebraic geometry, with the intention of doing a PhD and going into academia. I didn't exactly hit the wall your describing - I continued to do well in classes and produced a bit of decent research - but it stopped being fun for me. 

At some point I felt like I was just wading through an endless sea of dense notation and abstraction, with very little intuition left about the subjects I was studying. On top of that, I found the work very isolating. I was very siloed in my research, with nobody outside of my advisor I could really talk with about what I was doing. My mental health took a big hit.

I ended up finishing with a Masters degree instead, moved back to my hometown and spent a few summers working construction. 

Eventually I went back to school for a Masters in statistics and now I work as a wildlife biometrician. I still get to do a little bit of more theoretical research but my day to day involves working with tangible concepts. I can see the impacts of my work in real time, and I have colleagues I work with every day who aren't in my extremely specific field.

I have huge respect for those who are able to preserve and succeed in pure math, but I am so much happier for having given it up (even though I sometimes still feel a hint of guilt about it.)"
Galois Theory Humbled Me,"Graduate level abstract algebra, most egregiously the Hahn-Banach theorem. I put in the work, could toy with it, but it stopped making sense altogether - as far as my intuition and understanding of maths.

Everything up to that point felt natural. Not always easy, but always attainable, and soon enough it always became an extention of my intuitive math muscle. Then no more."
Galois Theory Humbled Me,"The way Galois theory is frequently taught is *awful*.  You're told this has to do with insolubility of the quintic, trisection of the angle, etc.  Then you're taught a bunch of stuff about fields that doesn't appear to have anything to do with any of this.  You're shown theorems without being given any idea why someone would want to consider these questions or what the results even mean.  And then if you slog through all that, at the end they show you some argument strung together from some of these results and it's just impossible to follow because you never grokked any of the stuff you were supposedly learning.

If people would just explain this stuff better I think it would lose a lot of its mystique and at the same time be something a lot more people were able to appreciate."
Galois Theory Humbled Me,"Abstract algebra has never really clicked for me. I can recall most definitions but the furthest in that direction I am generally willing to touch is operator algebras, due to the rather interesting connections to functional analysis. I am  far more comfortable working in all things analysis; I will stick through probability theory, differential equations, classical analysis, but algebra is simply not my thing. Perhaps I would have found it more intuitive if I sat through and tried to work through more problems, but I despised group theory pretty much from the beginning so I don't know feasible that would have been.

Also, I think suggesting intuition has a limit is somewhat misleading. Sure, some people are just naturally quick to pick up the ideas behind topics, but the general process involves a lot of grinding exercises and carefully reading proofs. It is simply not possible to remember all the important ideas in math without forcing yourself to interact with them in some way, and it is that process which builds up intuition. When I was exposed to analysis for the very first time it completely destroyed any sense of intuition I thought I had for calculus (see things like Thomae's function/Volterra's function to see just how ugly some analysis counterexamples can get), but I rebuilt it all from scratch eventually, with all the prior defects now fixed. It just takes a lot more effort to extend your knowledge past a certain point."
Galois Theory Humbled Me,"It's funny to me that you say Galois theory is ""effort"" and not ""tricks"", because imo Galois is probably one of the most ""tricksy"" studies there are. 

90% of a Galois theory book is about proving the fundamental theorem of Galois theory: ""A Galois extension admits a group - we will now call the Galois group. Properties of the extension can be read from properties of the group"".

Once you get that, a lot of work that went into proving this result can be forgotten. Proving things about extensions becomes regular group theory. The insolubility of the quintic depends on a property of S5, and that's literally it. 

I have found many times where the book I am reading doesn't work for me. I find that swapping between books can help."
Galois Theory Humbled Me,"Relying on intuition rather than listing examples sounds like a bit of a false dichotomy to me. Unless you have the intuition from the start, thinking about examples is probably the best way to build up your intuition!"
Galois Theory Humbled Me,"Reached that point multiples times, and it always turned out the barrier was self-made BS that could be broken with enough time and effort to master the basics leading up to it. There is a saying that there are three levels of knowledge -- ""knowing"", ""mastering"", and ""understanding"":

1. **Knowing:** At this level, you know what a topic means, where that topic connects to the rest, and recognize it when it occurs. This is what many call ""understanding"" already, so you need to be careful.
2. **Mastering:** At this level, you can comfortably and reliably apply the topic, even to new/unknown problems, and with minimal external sources. This is what many call ""deep understanding"".
3. **Understanding:** At this level, you can explain a topic in short, concise and intuitive terms to someone who does not know it (yet), using minimal/no external sources. Few ever reach this point.

Often when people say they ""understand"" easily and instantly, they really mean the first level. While it is easy to *believe* to have reached understanding, try to explain that topic to others (or yourself, really). The success (and how short/simple the explanations are) will tell whether understanding was really reached already."
Galois Theory Humbled Me,"Anecdotally, intuition comes from a combination of practice/training plus a natural ability for your brain to unconsciously see similarities between different concepts. 

Some people can get pretty far without practice. Most won’t. 

When you read this sentence it probably only took you a second or two, and you had a reasonable idea what I had written before you even got to the end. 

That’s also intuition. But your ability to use your natural intuition abilities for reading would be realllllly limited if you didn’t read regularly. Or never even learned to read in the first place. The reason why you have excellent intuition for written word is a lifetime of regular practice with reading.

Any links or help would be appreciated thank you.,"So you get E = 3D + 3. Now we can test those options. If D is greater than -1 (like 0, 1, 2, etc.), then 3 times D will be greater than -3. And when you add 3 to a number greater than -3, you definitely get a positive number. So, option C, “If D is greater than -1, E is positive,” is the one that holds up. The others don’t work; for instance, if D is -2 (which is greater than -3), E comes out as -3, which isn’t positive (that knocks out D) and isn’t always negative (knocking out B). For finding practice stuff, try searching terms like “solving linear equations for a variable practice,” “inequalities relationships practice,” or maybe “algebra function input output practice sheets.”"

My brain went ""43 is just 2 more than 41, so let's do 141 - 41 = 100, then take away 2 more to get 98"""
mental subtraction rounding question,"You can go either of those two ways, whatever your brain is most comfortable with. I personally would do 40, just because 141 already has a 40 that I can spot right off the bat, then subtract 3. If I am having a particularly bad day, I might subtract 40, then 1, then 2, just because I might not trust my brain in subtracting 101 - 3."
mental subtraction rounding question,">But for something like 141-43, should I round down to 40 (subtract 3), since 43 is closer to 40 than 50?
141-40 = 101, then subtract 3 → 101-3 = 98.

I'd round up to 143 and then subtract 2."
mental subtraction rounding question,">141-43

There is no single best way. This is often true in mathematics.

For this problem, you can do 143-43=100 and 100-2=98"
mental subtraction rounding question,"There's not a wrong answer as long as you consistently reverse the process. You could even ""round up"" to 141-100 as long as you add 57 back, but that wouldn't be an efficient use of your time. 

You'll find that you'll develop a preference depending on the number. When you're subtracting 72, you might decide to round to 70 since it's closer, but maybe you see the other number would subtract faster if you round to 80. It takes practice, but you can't go wrong as long as you reverse it correctly. 

And if you're subtracting a number that ends in 5, you might decide to not round that number at all and round the other number to a 5 as well. For example, 82-35 could be written as 85-35 to get 50 (and then subtract 3 from that)."
Probability and statistics,The answer must be negative
Probability and statistics,"Let ""r := (x; y)"" be the outcome of the 2d6-roll. Assuming both dice are fair and independent, all ""6^2 = 36"" outcomes for ""r"" are uniformly distributed, and it is enough to count favorable outcomes.

For each (ξ, η), count the number of favorable outcomes. Can you take it from here?"
What's the name of this identity,"As currently written, it comes out to e\^i = -e\^pi, which is nonsense; on the left is a complex number, on the right is a negative real.

So it's wrong, but it looks like an attempt at re-writing euler's identity, in which case the denominator in the exponent should be (i\*pi) instead of (i-pi).

* Euler's identity: e\^(i\*pi) = -1 
* Then to unnecessarily complicate things, replace (-1)= i\^2
* then just take the complex root over i\*pi: e = (i\^2)\^(1/i\*pi) (taking the root is the same as exponentiating to the inverse fraction.)
* And then bring to the other side.
* (i\^2)\^(1/i\*pi) - e = 0"
What's the name of this identity,"This is false. Let me expand this and show that it is not true in a very direct way.

First remember i^2 = -1. So we have

(-1)^(1/(i-pi))

Since the exponent is complex it is a good idea to rewrite this using logarithms

e^(ln(1/(i-pi)))

Next we should rationalize the fraction,

e^(ln((i+pi)/(pi^2 + 1))

Using log laws then gives

e^(ln(i+pi)) e^(-ln(pi^2+1))

Next, i+pi is equal to 1/sqrt(pi^2+1)exp(i arctan(1/pi)). So ln(i+pi) = i arctan(1/pi) - ln(pi^2+1)/2 + i pi k, where k is an integer

So overall we have something like

C e^(ix) 

Where C is a real constant and x = arctan(1/pi)+kpi, where k is an integer 

Since x is not a multiple of pi, this can not be real. Since e is real the equation must therefore be false."

Combinatorics Problem,"I'm having a little trouble interpreting the problem, which I suspect is what is slowing down commenters here. In particular, I'm foggy on what is meant by ""there is a linear order on the set of children on each node"". We can resolve the ambiguity by you answering this question: what is a\_3? (I'm *guessing* that it's 6, in which case we can proceed, but it might be 3.)

Second, is it not the case that a\_n is 0 when n is odd? The ""even number of children"" condition seems to force this. If a\_4 is *not* 0, that's another indication that I'm not understanding the conditions, and it would really help if you would show any example on \[4\]."

How do i find the value of x or any letter?,"Your question is too vague to really answer, but I can try to say something helpful.

In basic algebra, letters are just numbers that you don’t know yet. Instead of writing

4 + __ = 10

and filling in the blank with a 6, we write

“Solve 4 + x = 10,”

and the answer is that x = 6. There are several advantages to using letters instead of just blanks. One is that you could have multiple unknown values, and using letters makes it clear which ones are the same.

__ × 5 - 8 = __

could be filled in lots of ways, but writing

5x – 8 = x

tells us those two mysteries have to be the same number (if they could be different, we might write 5a – 8 = b instead). Solving that equation requires a few steps:

5x – 8 = x

5x – 8 **– x** = x **– x**

4x – 8 = 0

4x – 8 **+8** = 0 **+ 8**

4x = 8

4x **/ 4** = 8 **/4**

x = 8/4

x = 2

although with practice several of those steps can be combined or done in one’s head.

---

Sometimes y is just another letter (another unknown number). Sometimes x and y are used to describe the location of points on a plane. Then with an equation like “y = x + 1”, some points will make that equation true (like (x,y) = (4, 5)) and some points will not fit that equation (like (x, y) = (2, 7)). The collection of all points that make the equation true is the “graph” of the equation; in the case of y = x + 1 the graph is a diagonal line."
How do i find the value of x or any letter?,"totally get where you’re coming from this part of math can feel confusing at first but once it clicks it gets easier real fast

when they say something like “x equals something find y” it means they’re just giving you a clue to plug into an equation like if they give you y = 2x + 1 and tell you x = 3 all you do is substitute that number into the equation wherever x is so you do y = 2 times 3 plus 1 that’s y = 6 + 1 so y = 7

same thing if you’re told y = 10 and the equation is y = 5x
you just set 10 = 5x and ask yourself what times 5 gives you 10 the answer is x = 2
you’re just working backward like solving a little puzzle"
How do i find the value of x or any letter?,"X is just the way we write the unknown variable. By itself X can be anything. When given an equation like y+x=2 and you know y=1, then x=1 because 1+1=2

How do you find X? Well it really depends on the problem you have on your hand, most of the time you just need to plug a formula, that if you follow correctly will give you the value/s of x

I'll give you a real world example. How much will you have left in the pocket, if you have 6$ and buy a croissant that costs 1$? 

In this case X is the money we are looking for after you buy the croissant therefore X=6$-1$ 

Math letters are there as substitutions to something else, in this case X=(money you would have left after buying the croissant) and because that is a bit harder to write neatly, we just use letters like  x,y,z,a,b etc. 

If you are searching for the Area of a rectangle A=a•b depending on the values they have given you, X could be any of those letters, because they would be an unknown variable. If A is unknown, but you know a=2 and b=5 then you just need to plug them in the formula A=2•5 => A=10 and you have solved for A. If you know A=10 and a=2, but you are searching for b(this is your x), then 10=2•b, so what is 10 if you multiply it by 2? That's right 5, which means b=5 

That's mostly the jist of it. Without you providing specific examples of course."
How do i find the value of x or any letter?,"As the other person said, it's a bit to vague to answer, but if you mean like when you have two equations with x and y terms it could be useful to look up the strategies of substitution and elimination. Both of which function by getting rid of one of the terms so that you can find the other term. You then input the value for one of the variables you just solved for into one of the two original equations and that eliminates the first variable, letting you solve for the second."
"[functions, sets, mapping] Proving f maps A onto B given two other functions","I'd interpret this as ""for all sets C with associated maps g,h, if gf = hf then also g = h"". You find similar statements like that around universal properties for example.

I think this works as a proof if you want some hints (try proving it yourself though!):

>!Assume f is not surjective. Then there exists b in B such that f(a) ≠ b for all a in A.!<

>!Take C = B. Consider g = id_B the identity on B and for any b' in B define h_b' via h_b'(b) = b' and h_b' = id_B otherwise.
Clearly g and any such h_b' restrict to the same maps on the image of f (they differ at most at b, but that's not in the image by assumption). Hence g ∘ f = h_b' ∘ f.!<

>!By assumption this means that g = h_b' for any b'.!<

>!Thus we must in particular have b = g(b) = h_b'(b) = b' for all b' in B and hence B is a singleton set.!<

>! If B truly is a singleton set then any map into B with nonempty domain is surjective; if it is not then that's directly a contradiction. Hence by contradiction f must be surjective if A is nonempty. It's clear that the statement is incorrect in the general case when A is empty and B nonempty. !<"

Do not avoid the term codomain, it is nonnegotiable. But already know what it is. It's simply the allowed output space. So f(x)=x^(2). has the codomain R, even if it doesn't successfully output negative ones.

it's awkward and takes a sec (i don't write anything extra) but with enough practice, your arithmetic can be almost perfect cuz you gotta be wrong twice in a row for the mistake to make it on paper

Not as useful for calc.

How do I avoid making silly mistakes?,"I’ve been a private math tutor for more than 25 years, and I still make silly mistakes.  

A lot of practice will minimize the number of mistakes you make, yes, but you can help yourself in another way, too.  

I tell my students to solve each problem or partial problem in two ways. The result should be the same at the end of both procedures. If they are, it means that probably no mistake was made. If they aren’t, you can still check to see where you made a mistake before delivering your answer, homework or exam.  

For example, yesterday I wanted to know the product of 28 and 9. I got it by multiplying the factors just as they teach it in school. And, since I know that 28 x 10 is 280, I got it again by subtracting 28 from 280. I got the same result in both procedures, so I guess my answer is right.  

I tell my students that it’s not about being perfect. It’s more about knowing how to notice that you did or didn’t make a mistake. Sometimes I’m in the middle of a procedure and I say “this is wrong.” Then I immediately ask the student “how did I realize that this is wrong?” “What was the clue?”"
How can I break out of overly procedural thinking,I solved it the hard way which is brute forcing even more problems so that they arent unfamiliar come exam time 🤣
How can I break out of overly procedural thinking,"One possible method is to learn how to work problems backwards. When we start learning things, it is normal to search for a starting point, then memorize the process from that starting point towards a requested end point. This is absolutely normal. 

The next level of competency is to look for patterns so that the student is comfortable with multiple starting points. The idea here is to find the pattern inherent in the solution process and figure out how to ""see"" this pattern from a problem so that the missing parts can be filled in to give the solution. This is why a standard answer to ""why can't I get better?"" is to practice more. Practice hones this pattern matching skill.

The next thing to consider is to break problems down into smaller bits rather than trying to solve problems whole cloth. And one technique that may be useful is working backwards. Ask yourself, what should the answer look like. Given the answer, what would be the likely step preceding this answer. Then look for what needs to happen before. So for every given ""procedure"" - try seeing both how to work it forwards and try to see how it works in reverse."
How can I break out of overly procedural thinking,"The key for me is understanding what you are doing. Let's take a simple example. Let's say you have been taught that:

(area of rectangle) = (length) × (width)

You have done hundreds of calculations where you are given a length and a width and find the area. Then, without warning, you are given a problem where you are given the area of the rectangle and one of the sides. 

Now, for pretty much everyone reading this, this is trivial. You either know algebra well enough to rearrange the equation or you know rectangles well enough to be understand how this all works and the equation you are given is just a reflection of the properties of a rectangle. 

I'd recommend trying this approach. When you have an equation or algorithm try to understand how it works and why it is the way it is. 

Now, unless you are really clever (more so than me) there will always be equations that (at least at this point in your journey) you find yourself unable to understand in this way. For those you just keep practicing and memorising. Doing by rote is better than not being able to at all but understanding leads to being able to do more."

* **k-Combinations:** ""C(n; k) = n! / (k!\*(n-k)!)"" returns the number of ways to select ""k out of n"" distinguishable object. Order does *not* matter.

Notice ""C(n; k) = P(n; k) / k!"" -- for every k-combination, there are exactly k! ways to arrange them as k-permutations."

How do you determine dimensions of a cylinder with only a volume and surface area?,"great question and it’s a fun one because it flips the usual problem on its head. normally you’re given the radius and height and asked to find volume or surface area but if you’re given volume and surface area instead you can actually work backwards using the formulas. for a cylinder the volume is V equals pi times r squared times h and the surface area is A equals 2 times pi times r times h plus 2 times pi times r squared. so now you have two equations with two unknowns which are the radius and the height

to solve it you can isolate one variable in one equation and substitute it into the other. for example take the volume formula and solve for h in terms of r so h equals V divided by pi times r squared. then plug that into the surface area formula and simplify. this gives you a single equation with just r which you can then solve either algebraically or numerically. once you have r you can plug it back into your earlier expression for h. it can get a little messy algebra-wise but it’s totally doable and it’s a great example of how geometry and algebra come together to reverse engineer shapes from just a few properties"

How to find vectors that are orthogonal to a given vector in 2d and 3d?,"In 2D, switch the coordinates and flip one of their signs.  For instance, [2,5] and [5,-2] are orthogonal.

How to find vectors that are orthogonal to a given vector in 2d and 3d?,"You could start by finding another vector in the same plane as the given one, which should be relatively simple as you just need one point on the original vector and another somewhere on the plane. The vector between these points is definitely on the same plane as the original vector. Then, just cross these vectors and that gives you an orthogonal one."
How to find vectors that are orthogonal to a given vector in 2d and 3d?,"Well, if x=(x_1,...,x_n) and y=(y_1,...,y_n) are elements of R^n 
and <x,y>=0, then x and y are said to be orthogonal. So, given a fixed element  y of R^n, the vectors orthogonal to y are all the vectors x in R^n such that <x,y>=0. Now, we have that scalar products have of x and y is defined as <x,y>=\sum_{j=1}\^n (x_j •y_j).

So, if y=(3,-1,-1/3), then the vectors orthogonal to y are all the elements x=(x_1,x_2,x_3) in R^3 whose coordinates satisfy (x_1•3)+(x_2•-1)+ (x_3•-1/3)=0. Clearly the vector 0 in R^3 is orthogonal to y since it orthogonal to every vector, so the interesting case is when x is non-zero, this is when x_1, x_2, x_3 are NOT all null.

So the solution to the equation 3x_1-x_2-(x_3)/3=0 is clearly x_3=9x_1-6x_2."
How to find vectors that are orthogonal to a given vector in 2d and 3d?,"Another option in 3d is to use the cross product. Given two vectors, the cross product will produce a third vector orthogonal to both of the others; so if you start with a vector A, you can pick any vector Z that isn't a scalar multiple of A, and then take B = AxZ and C = AxB. Then A, B, and C will all be mutually orthogonal."
How to find vectors that are orthogonal to a given vector in 2d and 3d?,"Keep in mind in 2d  there is only one vector ⟂ your given vector (and all scalar multiples of that vector)

Qual é Potência de um radical?,The nth root of x = x^1/n
I understand math but can't execute,"Hi! Math teacher here. Your problem is pretty common, often times students grasp concepts and explanations but misuse or misinterpret them during exams.

The most common cause is a student ignoring (or only skimming) their textbooks. (Good) textbooks are designed to introduce a definition, build upon it, and then challenge it. 

As a student, you must understand that applying concepts in mathematics, logically, leads to new conclusions and understandings of the topic. As a teacher, there is only so much I can teach during classes. Mostly introductory or fundamental concepts for your understanding, but not that much beyond that.

Here is an example:

When teaching an introductory course to mathematical logic, one will teach basic set theory, and with it, De Morgan's Law:

(AUB)^c = A^c ∩ B^c

However, it is common to leave it to students to prove that such law is true for any finite number of sets (via induction) and then for an infinite family of sets.

Both of these statements could be good exam questions that students should have tried to do by simply following a good textbook."

calculus problem,"Yep -- you could also define ""C' := C + 1/4"" to make it more obvious."
where does this formula come from?,"Okay, so the first thing you have to realize is that ""angle between the planes"" is always measured perpendicular to the line of intersection AB. That's because the angle actually changes depending on which direction you measure it (as demonstrated by the problem itself, the measured angle at 60° is a different angle) and if you measure parallel to AB, that angle is 0° (because the planes are co-incident there). As you rotate the measurement, the angle increases until you are perpendicular to AB. So the ""angle between the planes"" is really the *maximum* angle between the two planes.

So the question is really, ""given the angle measured at 90°, what's the angle measured at 60°?"" To conceptualize this question let's imagine a right triangle whose base is on AB and whose hypotenuse is on MN (the triangle therefore lives on plane b). We'll draw the triangle so the hypotenuse is length 1. The other side of our triangle (the side not on AB or MN) is perpendicular to AB because we made a right triangle and therefore has a length of sin(60°), aka sin(c). Let's call this side BN because it connects AB to MN. The angle BN forms with plane a is also therefore the angle between the planes, angle b.

If we project our triangle down onto plane a, we get two new right triangles by drawing a line connecting the corner of our original triangle with the projected triangle. This connecting line is perpendicular to plane a. One triangle is created by projecting BN and another is created by projecting MN. And the key question is ""what is the length of this connecting line?"". We can see that because our original hypotenuse is length 1, then the length of this line must be sin(a), because the triangle connecting MN to the projection of MN has precisely the angle we are looking for, angle a (the angle measured at 60°).

Looked at another way, that length must be the height of BN above plane a. BN has a length of sin(60°), aka sin(c), and BN is the hypotenuse of the triangle connecting BN to the projection of BN. BN forms angle b with the projection of BN, therefore the height of BN above plane a must be sin(b)sin(c).

So, the length of the connecting line is both sin(a) and sin(b)sin(c)."

"If derivatives aren't fractions, why is dz/dy * dy/dx = dz/dx??","The thing is, intuitively we think about this as a fraction, but when we were formalizing this stuff way back we took an approach that didn't treat derivatives as fractions. This is called standard analysis and indeed in this view dy/dx is not a fraction, but it still satisfies many properties fractions satisfy, such as the one you mentioned.


There was a newer approach called non standard analysis which does treat dy/dx as a fraction but this is more niche and less useful to our current understanding of math.


Finally, it's worth noting you can't conflate an if p then q statement with it's converse if q then p. It's true if we have a fraction then it satisfies the properties of a fraction, but you are using this to assert if something satisfies a property of a fraction, it is a fraction, which isn't a sound leap."
"If derivatives aren't fractions, why is dz/dy * dy/dx = dz/dx??","It's mostly just a matter of notation.  We write it that way to remind us how the chain rule works.

It's not that they really are fractions, just that we know how fractions work, and the chain rule works similarly."
"If derivatives aren't fractions, why is dz/dy * dy/dx = dz/dx??",Just because A implies B and B is true does not imply A is true. Classic logical blunder.
"If derivatives aren't fractions, why is dz/dy * dy/dx = dz/dx??","Part of why this notation behaves like ordinary fractions is that derivatives are defined to be the limits of an expression that is an ordinary fraction.

"If derivatives aren't fractions, why is dz/dy * dy/dx = dz/dx??","Omg none of the answers here are satisfying to me. I hope some people find this helpful.

**It’s strange** to have such a simple equation that holds true for complicated functions, but the key idea is the derivative describes a function near a given point, and close enough to that point the function is essentially a straight line.

To sum up the university real analysis answer to this in terms aimed at a calculus student:
- Convince yourself that the chain rule works for straight lines like Y=mx+b
- In general when you pick a single x and find the tangent lines for Y and Z at x and y(x), you’re now back to the easy straight line scenario. The slope of (Z o Y) is the product of the slopes of Z and Y individually."

"If derivatives aren't fractions, why is dz/dy * dy/dx = dz/dx??","I've had a love hate relationship with that notation. Yes, it does point out a very important property in calculus but it's hard to get a kid learning it to wrap their heads around the fact that it's 'kind of' like a fraction but don't treat it as one (know this helping my hs son on his calc homework)."
"If derivatives aren't fractions, why is dz/dy * dy/dx = dz/dx??","I am seeing a lot of ""non-answers"" here.  They aren't actually answering your original question about why the chain rule looks like we are just ""canceling"" part of a fraction.

It's because derivatives (e.g. dy/dx) and differentials (e.g. dx and dy) satisfy the following rule (for one variable fuctions):

dy = (dy/dx)\*dx

and this should make sense: the small change in y is equal to the small change in x times the rate

However this means that if dz = (dz/dy)\*dy, then you can plug in the above differential for dy (*chain* them together) and get dz = (dz/dy)\*(dy/dx)\*dx.  This tells us that the ""rate"" of dz per dx is the product of dz per dy and dy per dx. 

This translates to the equation dz/dx = dz/dy\*dy/dx

*However* when there is more than one variable, the equation for the differential gets more complicated.  If z = f(x,y), then 

dz = dz/dx\*dx + dz/dy\*dy  

At this point, it's not directly acting like a single fraction, and so you get some weird identities, like 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_product_rule

Also, if we really could treat derivatives and differentials the same as fractions, then the above equation would reduce to dz = dz + dz, which makes so sense."
"If derivatives aren't fractions, why is dz/dy * dy/dx = dz/dx??","You can verify it yourself (a general case) right now by using the difference quotient definition of the derivative and a few limit laws. You can think of it the other way around. It’s not that we can simplify like fractions just cuz they look like fractions, but rather we chose to use notation that looks like fractions because they have this fractional simplification property"
"If derivatives aren't fractions, why is dz/dy * dy/dx = dz/dx??","A boring response would be to say that this is a coincidence, and one of the reasons why many people tend to prefer the Leibniz notation over the others.

A more interesting explanation involves thinking rigorously in terms of differentials.

We define the differential dt(t, del t) = del t. Then if x = f(t), we define the differential dx(t, del t) = f'(t) dt(t, del t).

Making the substitution dt = del t, we see that dx(t, del t) = f'(t)\* del t is a function taking the value of the argument of x, and an arbitrary ""step-size"" and returning the change of x as approximated by the linear approximation at that point. 

What makes things interesting is what happens when we expand this view to function composition.

Suppose z = h(y) and y = g(x), we can still write dz(y, del y) = h'(y) dy(y, del y), but what if we want to write in terms of x?

We have z = h(g(x)), so we have dz(x, del x) = \[h(g(x))\]' dx(x, del x), and using the chain rule we get h'(g(x))\*g'(x) dx(x,del x). But g'(x) dx(x,del x) is the definition of dy(x,del x)!

So, technically, we could write dz(x, del x) = h'(g(x)) dy(x, del x), then taking the quotient of both sides (assuming dy =/= 0) we get

dz(x,del x)/dy(x,del x) = h'(g(x)).

Similarly, if we look at dy(x,del x)/dx(x,del x) = g'(x).

Then dz(x,del x)/dy(x,del x) \* dy(x,del x)/dx(x,del x) = dz(x,del x)/dx(x,del x) by the ordinary rules of algebra, and it ""just so happens"" that this is the same as \[h'(g(x))\] \* \[g'(x)\] = h'(g(x))\*g'(x) = \[h(g(x))\]', which you should recognize as the ordinary chain rule.

What's important to recognize with this particular way of reasoning about it is that a differential is actually a *function of multiple variables* rather than a variable or limit."
"If derivatives aren't fractions, why is dz/dy * dy/dx = dz/dx??","Derivatives aren't fractions because dx, dy, and dz aren't numbers. It's not a fraction for the same reason 0/0 × 0/0 = 0/0 isn't a fraction.

They do have some traits that fractions gave tho."
"If derivatives aren't fractions, why is dz/dy * dy/dx = dz/dx??","Yes, derivatives aren't fractions. dz/dx is just a notation, not a fraction. 

The equality just happens to be correct. Because of a theorem. Not because they are fractions."
"If derivatives aren't fractions, why is dz/dy * dy/dx = dz/dx??","Let us take a z =f(x) and let y be some variable not related to x or z. 
In that case, 
dz/dy = dy/dx = 0. 

But, dz/dx  can be made to be non zero. 

So, you are mis-stating the chain rule without proper assumptions. 

In general, derivatives give the growth rate of a function to the first order. It is easy to see that composing two linear functions leads to a product of the slopes."
"If derivatives aren't fractions, why is dz/dy * dy/dx = dz/dx??","I'm not sure if this is actually your hangup, but it's worth a try: Do you realize that the logic behind your question is analogous to asking: ""If oranges aren't apples, then why are they sweet?""

Apples share some features with apples, but that doesn't make them apples. Derivatives share some features with fractions, but that doesn't make them fractions."
"If derivatives aren't fractions, why is dz/dy * dy/dx = dz/dx??",They do behave quite similarly to fractions. Which is kind of intuitive if you think of the derivative as a limit of smaller and smaller measurements. But as often it is tricky once you do stuff where the limits don't converge anymore.

"If derivatives aren't fractions, why is dz/dy * dy/dx = dz/dx??","As someone with a physics background. I've always intuitively thought of derivatives as fractions, and generally in most ""regular"" scenarios they do behave as ones. They were designed as ratios of two ""infinitely small"" numbers. 


Now of course when you start to formalize this mathematically you realize that dividing ""infinitely small"" things is poorly defined, so you come up with some strict definitions with limits etc. And then you find some edge cases where the formal definition doesn't behave like a fraction.


But realistically, when you are applying math as a tool to the real-world problems (mechanics etc.), you do think of derivatives as fractions, that's how you justify that you need a derivative and not some other mathematical construct."

The notation is natural enough to reflect this, but that doesn't mean the mathematics is this way because of the notation. 

3b1b has a nice video about this, you should check it out."
"If derivatives aren't fractions, why is dz/dy * dy/dx = dz/dx??","I don’t think anyone here has given a truly satisfying answer but this works because of the chain rule: in analysis, a derivative is more thought of the idea of “expanding your function” around a point x0. Let us define f = g o h. g is differentiable in x0 if g(x) = g(x0) + a(x-x0) + o(x-x0). Where o(x-x0)/(x-x0) goes to 0 as x approaches x0 and a = g’(x0). We can give the same definition for h. 

Using this, we can rigorously show f’(x0) = h’(x0) * g’ o h(x0)  which is an equivalent definition for df/dy = dh/dx * dg/dh. Thus this is why we can treat derivatives as fractions, not because they are but because the chain rule holds for any differentiable function which is why in physics we can multiply stuff by dx to solve differential equations.

HOWEVER, this absolutely is not true for partial derivatives as the chain rule is defined as a sum, thus we cannot treat them as functions"
"If derivatives aren't fractions, why is dz/dy * dy/dx = dz/dx??","Imo the ""iT's NOt a fRActiOn"" thing is overstated.

It's a limit of a fraction and most of analysis is about ""swapping"" a limit with some operation. When you can do the swap, calculations amount to calculations with fractions... taken to a limit.

Usually the times when it's ""not a fraction"" is when some implicit assumption you're making by ""considering it as a fraction"" fails to hold. For example the inverse function theorem could be summarised to
""dy/dx*dx/dy=1"".
But by writing those fractions, you're implicitly assuming that x can locally be expressed as a function of y and that none of the denominators are 0. These roughly correspond to the conditions of the theorem."
"If derivatives aren't fractions, why is dz/dy * dy/dx = dz/dx??","Another way to think about the derivative is that is a linear operator acting on a function. One can prove that for most F (other notation/ computational work may be needed) is a linear operator. And in the space we know that since it is linear it holds for multiplication (that is specific to order - ie not communicative) and scalar addition. 

Thus it can be more intuitively seen that this relationship is ture and not just common multiplication due to restrictions on the space that force it to be linear. 

Most of this comes from abstract linear algebra or a class on differential equations that details solving methods and this is a property that arrises."
"If derivatives aren't fractions, why is dz/dy * dy/dx = dz/dx??","Just remember the chain rule. If z is a function of y which is a function of x, then to see how changing x affects z we look at how changing x affects y and then how changing y affects z."
"If derivatives aren't fractions, why is dz/dy * dy/dx = dz/dx??","It's just the chain-rule in informal notations. Consider

    d/dx  z(y(x))  =  z'(y(x)) * y'(x)

Notice the informal way hides that we use ""y(x)"" as argument for z'."
"If derivatives aren't fractions, why is dz/dy * dy/dx = dz/dx??","It's just a symbolic way to work with the distribution rule:

( f(g(x)) )' = f'(g(x)) g'(x)

But there is no problem thinking about it as a fraction imo. We do so meany other operations symbolically and without thinking about the technical details. Just make sure you're only doing it with nice functions and you shouldn't run into any problems."
"If derivatives aren't fractions, why is dz/dy * dy/dx = dz/dx??","Chain rule. A derivative is a ratio (change in output over change in input), so many properties of fractions translate into properties of derivatives. 

In this example, the first factor is ratio of change in z over change in y (with y as input and z as output). The second is ratio of change in y over change in x (with x as input and y as output). So it’s not surprising that their product is change in z over change in x (with x as input and z as output)."
"If derivatives aren't fractions, why is dz/dy * dy/dx = dz/dx??","Because dz/dy etc. are mere symbols of a process, not the actual computations of rational quantities.

They're symbolic.   Don't read them literally.   All they express is the transitivity of the differentiation process.

Some writers use the symbol d' instead of d/dx, thereby circumventing the more traditional fraction-looking symbol.

"If derivatives aren't fractions, why is dz/dy * dy/dx = dz/dx??","Could you stop repeating the same question, please?"
"If derivatives aren't fractions, why is dz/dy * dy/dx = dz/dx??","This is the chain rule. The neatest, simplest and high-level moral explanation is that differentiation is “functorial”. This means that if we have diff maps f: X —> Y and g : Y —> Z, then differentiation gives us maps between the tangent bundles D(f): TX —> TY, D(g): Y —> Z. Here TX, TY,… are geometric objects encoding the tangent spaces to X,Y I.e. they encode the linear information (if X is a curve in the plane, TX is the collection of all tangent lines to the curve at different points). 

We also have the composite function g o f : X —> Z. 

The chain rule then is basically equivalent to saying: D(g o f) = D(g) o D(f).

In other words, we can either differentiate the composite function, or composite the derivatives and the answer is the same. 

Ofc we then have to prove this, and that often is done on the level of limits (as df/dx is in terms of limits), but this is just a calculation: letting h = g o f you expand out the expression (h(x+e) - h(x))/e for e small, approximately in terms of derivatives of f,g."
"If derivatives aren't fractions, why is dz/dy * dy/dx = dz/dx??", One framework due to Caratheodory is that the derivative is the scale factor of small neighborhoods so f(g(x)-f(g(x\_0)=k\_1\*(g(x)-g(x\_0)) as |g(x)-g(x\_0)| shrinks and and k is the derivative of f(x) at g(x\_0) but since g(x) is diferentiable g(x)-g(x\_0)=k\_2(x-x\_0) as |x-x\_0| shrinks to 0 putting these together we have f(g(x)-f(g(x\_0)=k\_1g(x)-g(x\_0)= k\_1k\_2(x-x\_0) for sufficiently small |x-x\_0| so since k\_1=f'(g(x) and k\_2=g(x) we have that f(x) stretches (x-x\_0) by a factor of k\_1k\_2 for sufficiently small g.
"If derivatives aren't fractions, why is dz/dy * dy/dx = dz/dx??","The '\*' in dz/dy \* dy/dz is not multiplication, it is composition."
"If derivatives aren't fractions, why is dz/dy * dy/dx = dz/dx??","Here is an intuitive explanation:

dz/dy means that z is a function of y  
dy/dx means that y is a function of x  
so indirectly z is also a function of x

dz/dy gives you how much z changes if y changes a tiny little bit  
dy/dx gives you how much y changes if x changes a tiny little bit  
\-so they're really ratios, easy to intepret them that way

 dz/dy \* dy/dx, is the change in z if y changes a little bit, multiplied by the change in y when x changes a little bit.  Which gives you the change in z if x changes a little bit.   
=> dz/dy \* dy/dx = dz/dx

Another way to thing about it is when x changes by dx (a very small change in x), y changes by dy. When y changes by dy, z changes by dz.   
So dz/dx = dy/dx \* dz/dy, because when x changes by dx, y changes by dy, and when y changes by dy, z changes by dz

the underlying logic is x changes y, and y changes z. So if you multiple those to ratios you get how much x changes z directly"

If z is in the left hand side set, then z ∈ intₓ (S) and z ∈ Y.  From the definition of intₓ(S) we know z ∈ S and there is some open ball B centered on z with B ∩ X ⊆ S. But then  z ∈ S ∩ Y, and  B ∩ Y ⊆ (B ∩ X) ⊆ S and B ∩ Y ⊆ Y so we have  B ∩ Y ⊆ (S ∩ Y). From definition of int\_Y we have z ∈ int\_Y (S ∩ Y).

Geometry in differential equation solution space,"It can mean a lot, for example, if you map fluid concentration on homogenous dilutions, intersections may improve efficiency on chemical reactions.

Also modeling may help to raise (or diminish) temperature variance in fluid environments such as an iron smelter.

I'm using f'(x) notation to emphasize that the derivative function is what links the differentials. In that sense, it acts like a proportionality factor that changes value from point to point.

Left to right and order of operations.,"> When do I go left to right?

When the operators have the same precedence. Basically PE(MD)(AS)."
Left to right and order of operations.,"In the case of multiplication and division, division is usually written last, as a fraction (single term), or with parentheses, in order to remove ambiguity. If the division is unambiguous, then the operation is carried out in terms of numerator and denominator, until the expression can be expressed as a simplified fraction. For example, the evaluation of`3*15/9` is:

(3/1) \* (15/9) = (3\*15)/9 = 15/3 (taking out a factor of 3 from both the numerator and denominator) = 5

Addition and subtraction has a lower precedence than multiplication and division, so these operations should be performed later. These are applied to terms, to create an expression, which evaluates to a value. Any ""expression"" involving solely multiplication and division is a single term, and should be evaluated before it is added to or subtracted from another term. Individual values are also terms. Addition and subtraction of terms should be evaluated left to right, provided there are no parentheses. The evaluation of `5+4*12/16+18/3` is:

5 + 4\*12/16 + 18/3  
5 + 12/4 + 6  
5 + 3 + 6  
14"
Left to right and order of operations.,When it's all M and D or all A and S
Left to right and order of operations.,"It helps also if you keep the mathematical properties in mind. The basic ones being associativity, commutativity, and distributivity. But mostly the first two are helpful in doing the order of operations.

Because while we usually operate with the notion that when faced with equal priority (such as addition/subtraction) we work them from left to right, that is strictly not necessary. It makes it easier, so we usually do that.

For example, if I have this sequence of numbers:  
13+8+17+26+22

I don't have to go from left to right. They're all addition, so I can use the mathematical properties to rearrange them:  
13+17+8+22+26

Which helps me because I tend to add up groups that are divisible by 10. In my mind, I group them like:  
(13+17)+(8+22)+26 = 30+30+26 = 86

Same goes for subtraction:  
15-17+35-23+40 = (15+35) - (17+23) + 40 = 50-40+40

For that one, I used the distributive property to get -(17+23), though I could've grouped it as +(-17-23). That's just a bit trickier to manage though.

Same with multiplication and division, though division is a little bit trickier since that's best solved in fraction form. You can even switch numbers around within the same operator. For example, these are all equivalent:  
8\*7+4\*3 = 7\*8+3\*4 = 4\*3+7\*8 = 4(7\*2+3)

And you'll see this pop up on Facebook and other tripe, but if you see someone asking what is 6/2(2+1), just walk away. Because of implied multiplication, 1 can be a correct answer, but if you explicitly solve from left to right then 9 can also be a correct answer. This is shoddily written on purpose, and the best answer is to just not engage."

[Algebra] why 2a instead of 2|a| in the quadratic formula?,"The a in the b/2a is not squared and so it's sign matters. you could write the formula as x=  -b/2a ± sqrt(b2 -4ac)/2|a|, but notice that changing the sign of the |a| now just swaps the + and - solutions, so makes no difference"
[Algebra] why 2a instead of 2|a| in the quadratic formula?,"Good catch!

[Algebra] why 2a instead of 2|a| in the quadratic formula?,"You can avoid having the a\^2 when square rooting by instead multiplying everything by 4a at the start:

In the line where we factorised 4a\^2 x\^2 + 4abx + b\^2 we could have written (-2ax - b)\^2 instead, but the negative on the b cancels when we divide by -2a, and the ± sign would be ""flipped"" which we can neglect.

So, we proceed by assuming the fundamental theorem of algebra so if there are roots we have that our polynomial ax\^2+bx+c as a(x-r\_1)(x-r\_2).  


Matching coefficients we get b=-a(r\_1+r\_2) and c=a(r\_1r\_2) or r\_1r\_2=c/a.

We can see that subtracting 4c/a will get us b\^2/a\^2-4ac/a\^2=r\_1\^2-2r\_1r\_2+r\_2\^2=(r\_1-r\_2)\^2.  Taking the sqrt we get r\_1-r\_2=sqrt(b\^2-4ac.)/a or r\_2-r\_1=sqrt(b\^2-4ac)/a  which amounts to the same effect as taking |a| in the denominator then we proceed by gaussian elimination to get 2r\_1=-b/a+sqrt(b\^2-4ac.)/a or r\_1=-b/2a+sqrt(b\^2-4ac)/2a. r\_2=-b/a-r\_1=-b/2a-sqrt(b\^2-4ac)/2a. switching  the value by the other value of |a| merely swaps which root is r\_1 and r\_2

little doubt about lattice in discrete maths,"A lower bound of f and g is any x st x<=f and x<=g. A greatest lower bound is lower bound x st for any other lower bound y, x>y. Since a,b,c,e<f,g those are all lower bounds of f and g. Since a<b and c<e, neither a nor c are greatest lower bounds. Since b is not larger than e and e is not larger than b, neither of those are greatest lower bounds. So there is no greatest lowest bound. 

Another equivalent definition that i think you are sorta hinting at is: the greatest lower bound is the UNIQUE maximal element of the subposet of lower bounds, if it exists. This is not computing the greatest lower bound of the poset of lower bounds though. If you just draw the poset of lower bounds here, b and e are both maximal elements of it. Hence no greatest lower bound exists for this reason either."

Fractions,"Multiplying just go straight across, division you flip the second fraction and then multiply, and addition and subtraction just multiply the denominators together to find the common denominator and then simplify once the math is done."
Fractions,"First, practice. Being able to do the problems is really just the first step. Think of it as the beginning, not the end. Keep doing it until it's not just something you can do, but something that comes easily and quickly. When you learn a new skill or idea, it's natural for it to fade after a short time when you move on to other things. In order to really internalize the skill, you need to refresh it periodically over a longer period of time. Don't learn one thing at a time and then move on. As you're learning new skills and concepts, pay attention to past skills that may need to be refreshed.

Second, try not to think of each new skill as something to memorize independently. When you read about how to add fractions with different denominators, make sure that you understand why the method works. Tie it back to what adding means and what a fraction is. Justify each step with a general rule about numbers. (For example: ""a number multiplied by one is that same number"" or ""the sum of a first number and a second number is the same as the sum of the second  number and the first number"")

It's not always best to find a common denominator by multiplying the two given denominators. That always works, but it can leave you with a lot of extra work at the end. It's often easier to find a smaller common denominator, even though it takes more work at the beginning of the problem. It also takes more work to learn how to do the same problem in multiple ways, but I think it pays off. This is an example of the difference between memorizing a bunch of recipes for solving specific types of problems versus trying to build a deeper understanding. The extra work will make retaining these skills and learning new ones easier in the long run."

Is it possible to learn pre-algebra to algebra 2 in 5-6 months,"Questions along the lines of ""is it possible to learn \[subject\] in \[time frame\]?"" always get the same answer:

We don't know how smart you are, how naturally you take to maths as a topic, or how quickly you give up when things get hard (and they will). For this? **Yes, that's entirely reasonable for many people if they want to do it.** Some people will need barely any time to learn the topic you've asked about. Some will need loads.

As to whether or not Khan Academy is good enough: probably? It's the most commonly recommended resource for this site and it definitely covers the material you're interested in (though it might suggest starting with earlier topics than that if you take the placement test). 

The good news is that you're probably more mature, determined, and generally smarter than you were when you were first supposed to learn this. So it might be a lot easier. The bad news is that it is still going to take effort and you're going to have to push through and really try to master topics even where they're really hard.

You can do web courses and videos until the cows come home. But I like prepping for the clep exam because it gives you a tangible bar to pass. "
Is it possible to learn pre-algebra to algebra 2 in 5-6 months,"I'd recommend going back and mastering fractions. A lot of simplifying in algebra is fractions and you don't want to be fighting with fractions while trying to learn something else. I used Kahn Academy from fractions up through Algebra. You'll be surprised at how you fast can blitz it if you do the work. It's really all about understanding what the goal of the lesson is and getting reps in.  After that for me, community college supplemented with Professor Leonard through Calc 3. But I wasn't pressed for time."
Is it possible to learn pre-algebra to algebra 2 in 5-6 months,"yes, this happens all the time. Theres 2 week algebra 1 and 2 intercession courses at most community colleges.  I did my algebra 1 this way during winter, then algebra 2 during spring along with geometry, then trig in the fall. you can audit any class if you already taken them for 0 credit, its pretty common to do.  if you self study you can do it in a couple of months, udemy has a few courses."
Is it possible to learn pre-algebra to algebra 2 in 5-6 months,"The main thing is you have to actually **do** math.

So often I see people in your situation and they think ""I'll watch a bunch of videos and then I'll know math"", but it doesn't work that way. There are a lot of good materials for lectures, and you should watch a couple on each topic -- different teachers cover things from different angles, and getting a more complete view will always help.  But the only way to actually learn math is by doing it, and that means committing to a lot of practice, and you really need someone or somehow to check your work, point out problems, and guide you toward solutions.

Now, I haven't tried this yet, but it might even be that at this point ChatGPT can serve that purpose.  It has been notoriously bad at doing math in the past, but it has been improving a lot and I use it to explain complex topics to me all the time.  Having a person you can talk to would be better, but we don't all have teachers or tutors we can reach out to, this might be an option."

However, I suggest you ask CHATGPT for good books and YouTube channels. You probably already know some, if you are 23 years old, I think you have already watched some video class for some test. I don't know how the American education system works, but, going from the SAT point of view, I don't think it will be difficult for you to learn, I always get the SAT questions right (I'm even thinking about going to college there in the United States).

Is it possible to learn pre-algebra to algebra 2 in 5-6 months,"May I suggest an excellent book which covers high school math including basic calculus (derivatives, integrals, series, etc) in a very good, concise way in under 400 pages including exercises and solutions.

It’s called: “No Bullshit guide to Math and Physics” by Ivan Savov. 

Now, the author does an excellent job on explaining all concepts. BUT: You REALLY may need MORE PRACTICE PROBLEMS.

I suggest working through the book and having a tutor you can meet like once a week/every two weeks to help fill any gaps + explain exercises and concepts you do not understand.

That tutor could also be a friend or relative who has more knowledge in this field, particularly for the more basic stuff.

Understanding the concepts is one thing, but the essenctial thing is being able to apply it. That only comes with practice practice practice"

Check out The Math Sorcerer on Youtube recommends this PreAlgebra Text book https://youtu.be/sCNmLZpC-ic?feature=shared 

This book here is college level and covers everything you would have in a college class.

His recommendations are solid. Get the textbook used and get the student or instructors solutions manual to go with it and then create your personally syllabus and work through the texbook doing every problem. 


Each section has tons so you will have lots of practice. Basically get yourself a good textbook with accompanying solution guide and get to work on it daily. Do 10 to 30 Probe a day. Go slow first and once you.get comfortable with a section then quiz and test yourself with a timer 


You can get the used older Editions Many of the books are almost the same as the latest edition and the older ones are super affordable."
Is it possible to learn pre-algebra to algebra 2 in 5-6 months,"I think what you’re doing is very cool, I had a similar experience going into calculus(I had no clue what sine and cosine were and struggled to manipulate equations). You could do 4 hours a day, but I wouldn’t recommend going into this with that mindset. If you fall behind with that kind of goal, it will be a whole lot harder to catch up. Instead, I recommend a consistent goal you can totally crush (which will motivate you to keep going, remember that 5-6 months of focused consistent learning is better than 2 weeks of rushing and then never picking the subject up again). You are already in a program, you are busy already. 

Also, many people go into calculus with some gaps in their algebra knowledge and also their trigonometry knowledge. Many people pick this up as they take the class. you don’t need to know all of algebra. Generally, you just need a few tricks to do well in calculus.However people can pick things up on their own only because they have built the skill of learning how to learn math. 

So generally, don’t view this as learning how algebra, but instead learning how to learn math consistently. I know you wish to transfer soon, so here’s what I recommend: Instead of doing 4 hours a day, start by just doing 15 minutes a day every day. If you can manage that for a week, up it by 10 minutes in the next week. Continue increasing the time in small intervals (it can be more than 10 minutes if you think you can handle it) until you find a sweet spot in terms of studying time (2 good focused hours are MUCH better than 4 hours where you don’t really focus). It’s okay if you miss a few days here and there, I’d say it’s okay to move on if you’ve hit 5 days that week. This is a general guideline that may be helpful, but you know yourself best, so you may have to tweak it to meet your learning needs. Just please take it slow. 

One final tip: With everything you learn see if you can understand how it helps you solve real-world problems/ be a better thinker. This means you’ll engage with the material, and it will feel super cool to learn something new! You got this, feel free to message me with updates/questions along your journey.

why is algebra 1/math so hard for me,"Math is a tricky subject.  I think it would help to understand where you're having trouble.  Are you not understanding concepts?  Now knowing where to begin on a problem? Or just keep coming up with the wrong answer?  Without knowing how you're struggling, it's hard to know how to help.

I will say that you might want to check out YouTube channels like [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown) if you're having a problem understanding the concepts -- I know algebra is typically taught as a very abstract topic, and having nice animated visuals to go along with the algebra topics can make some concepts just ""click"" 

If you're just making dumb mistakes on your work (which is why you should show your work), then I have a few suggestions, but it ultimately just comes down to attention to detail.  One of the biggest things that helped for me was getting rid of all subtraction and division, and replace them with ""adding a negative"" and ""multiplying by the reciprocal"" respectively.  For example, instead of 10 - x, you do 10 + (-x) to enforce the idea that the minus goes with the x.

And finally, most math textbooks include a ""sheet sheet"" of formulas, rules, etc. on the inside of one of the covers.  Refer to it while you're doing your homework to reinforce the basics."

I’ve never failed a math course in high school so I can’t imagine the struggle you are going through, but I have failed math courses in  university and i understand the defeat. A great man once told me, adversity shows people who you really are.

Solution is to go back to the weak levels and fix them so you can build strong.  Go to Khan Academy and start from a few grades back, take the Course Challenge twice and then 100% the units you missed and then take the Course Challenge again.  Then go to the next grade and do the same thing again and so on until you're in Algebra.  For Algebra, watch the videos and do the exercises on Khan as well (get 100%), and that'll give you a good way to fix any gaps you have.  It's a lot of math, but you can do it.  Study a lot.

Imagine you have an **equation** like

2 + x = 5

This is the same as ""2 plus witch number is equal to 5"". This number is 3, so x = 3. But I have another method. For example, let's solve:

2x + 4 = 0

Well, I can remove the ""4"" subtracting 4 **both sides** (An equation is like a scale - it needs to be balanced. If you do something to one side, you must do it to the other.). So:

2x + 4 - 4 = 0 - 4

2x = - 4

We can divide by 2 both sides too:

2x/2 = -4/2

x = -2.

That's the solution :)

We have the **Quadratic Equation** too, like

x² + 2x - 4 = 0.

Well, let's define ""a"", ""b"" and ""c"":

x² + 2x - 4 = 0

\^      \^    \^ 

a       b     c                      (a = 1, b = 2, c = -4).

Now, we need to find the Δ:

Δ = b² - 4ac (You just replace the a, b and c with its valures)

Δ = (2)² - 4.1.(-4)

Δ = 4 + 16

Δ = 20

So, we need to find the 2 valures of x:

x' (the first x) = (- b + √Δ) / 2a

x'' (the first x) = (- b - √Δ) / 2a

We replace the b, Δ and a with its valures:

x' = (- 2 + √20)/2

x' = (- 2 + 2√5)/2

x' = - 1 + √5

x'' = x' = (- 2 - √20)/2

x'' = (- 2 - 2√5)/2

x'' = - 1 - √5

So, the solutions are - 1 + √5 and -1 - √5 :)

An inequality is an unbalanced scale (what value of x makes the scale unbalanced). 

\> -> The scale is with the right side lower. 

< -> The scale is with the left side lower. 

≥ or ≤ -> The scale is unbalanced (to the right or to the left) OR balanced. 

You do the same things you do in equations. This is the minimum you need to know (in my opinion). That way you will better understand the rest of the content (like, functions or notable products)."

Need help with problem (Discrete mathematics),"Have you made any progress? I've been musing on this for the past day, but I've not cracked it.  Here are some thoughts...

For ease of typing, I'm using [ ] for the floor function, and writing r = √2.

For the first part, we have 

n = [(r^l + r^(l-1))m].

Noting that (r^(l+1) + r^(l))m = r(r^l + r^(l-1))m,

and (using the hint) we want to show

[r (n + 1/2)] = [r(r^(l) + r^(l-1))m]

Another way of viewing the problem is that we want to show that the set of values of x for which [r([x]+1/2)] = [rx] includes all values that can be written in the form (r^l + r^(l-1))m for some integers l and m.  I've played with lots of examples, but not yet found a way in, so I've posted the question here: https://www.reddit.com/r/askmath/comments/1jjw3ca/how_to_show_that_the_integer_part_of_two/

(If that doesn't work I'll try https://math.stackexchange.com).

For the rest of the question, I think this is more straightforward.  L_0 = a, a positive integer.  It looks like the sequences with l=0 and l=1 cover all positive integers, by which I mean if you plug in l = 0, and m = 1, 2, 3,...  you get [(r^l + r^(l-1)m] = 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11,... and if you plug if l = 1, and m = 1, 2, ... you get [(r^l + r^(l-1)m] = 2, 4, 7, 9, 12, ... so between them all integers are output. (Not proved this).  So either there is an integer m between a/(1+1/r) and (a+1)/(1+1/r) or between a/(r+1) and (a+1)/(r+1), then respectively l=0 or l=1, so [(1+1/r)m] = a or [(r+1)m] = a.

So a = [x] for some x = (r^l + r^(l-1))m, and that means we can apply the result from the first part of the question: L\_1 = [(r^(l+1) + r^(l))m] = [rx], L\_2 = [r^(2) x] and so on ie L\_n = [r^n x].

(By the way, the hint follows from the fact that 2n(n+1) is an integer and 2(n+1/2)^2 = 2n(n+1) + 1/2 so there can be no integer between 2n(n+1) and 2(n+1/2)^2 so certainly no square number between them, so taking square roots, no integer between √{2n(n+1)} and √{2(n+1/2)^(2)})."
Need help with problem (Discrete mathematics),"Yeah understood the first part from your proof, thanks

How do I write sin and cos functions based off a graph?,Do you know the difference between degrees and radians? This may be the discrepancy you are seeing
How do I write sin and cos functions based off a graph?,"For this I recommend you start the other way - you learn to build a function step by step.  You can use Khan Academy to do that, they actually have a pretty good sequence with quick videos to help you do that.

Basically it's as follows:

sin = opposite/hypotenuse (y value on the unit circle)

cos = adjacent/hypotenuse (x value on the unit circle)

The charts are actually identical, but they're offset by a bit.  cos starts at the 'peak' of the wave, and sin starts in the 'middle' of the wave (going up).  If you shifted the  cos wave by pi/2 to the right, it'd be a perfect overlay on sin.  So you can actually use either function and shift them around.

to create a sin chart (can apply this to cos as well), step by step.

y = sin(x) -> this is a periodic function, the period is 2pi, amplitude is 1, midpoint is 0, when x=0, y=0.

y = a\*sin(x) -> the 'a' is the multiplier for the amplitude.  If the amplitude is 2, the a is 2, if it's 0.4, then a is 0.4.

y = a\*sin(b(x)) -> the 'b' is the squeeze for the period.  If you use a '2' for b, then the period would shift from 2pi to 1pi.  If you used a '1/2' for b, then the period would shift from 2pi to 4pi.  You can thing of it as 2pi being the numerator of the period and the 'b' being the denominator, so the period is (2pi)/b.

y = a\*sin(b(x-c)) -> the 'c' is the horizontal shift.  If 'c' is 1pi, then you would shift the function to the right by 1pi.  sometimes this is expanded, like y=a\*sin(bx-bc), which I don't like because it makes it harder to parse.

y = a\*sin(b(x-c)) + d -> the 'd' is the  vertical shift.  It shift the midpoint up by d.

So once you get used to building sine functions (and cos) then you will be able to read existing ones by identifying the midpoint, amplitude, period and horizontal shift and then plugging them in."

prpving that square roots of primes are irrational,pretty much although the standard way is to instead use the characterization of primes that is ab is divisible by p then either a is divisible by p or b is divisble by p so you do p=a\^2/b\^2 or pb\^2=a\^2 so p divides a but then you get pb\^2=p\^2l\^2 so p divides b as well so we have a contradiction if a/b is in simplest form.
prpving that square roots of primes are irrational,"The first line to the second is incorrect. The multiplicative closure of the integers only means that multiplying two integers gets you another integer. It does not mean that if the product of two rational numbers is an integer they are both integers. Even if the integer is prime. For example 4 × 0.5 = 2.

It is true that if the square of a rational number is an integer, it is an integer. But I doubt you can use this fact under the guise of ""multiplicative closure of the integers""."
prpving that square roots of primes are irrational,"If a number is of the form a^2, (perfect square), then it must have at least two factors, a and a. Then it is not prime.

What is derivative and how to interpret it,"A (differentiable) function being strictly increasing does not imply that the derivative must be positive, only nonnegative. Your example shows why.

An intuitive way to understand it is that the instantaneous rate of change is zero, and even the instantaneous rate of change of the instantaneous rate of change is zero, but the instantaneous rate of change of the instantaneous rate of change of the instantaneous rate of change (ie, f'''(0)) is not zero. So f is not changing linearly at 0, but it is still changing."
What is derivative and how to interpret it,"Another way to interpret differentiation is that it's an approximation of the function by an affine function.

in the case of x->x^3, yes it is increasing, but so slowly around 0 that it is almost flat."
What is derivative and how to interpret it,"The value of the derivative is the slope of the tangent on that point. If the derivative is 0 it only means that the tangent on that point is horizontal, but that doesn't say anything about what the functions will be doing before or after that point."
What is derivative and how to interpret it,"Some people will mean strictly increasing to mean it never decreases, in that case the value could be 0 but no less. Other people will use strictly increasing to mean always greater than 0 and use non-decreasing to mean the value is always 0 or greater. 

This is one problem as you get into more advanced math, terminology isn’t always consistent. It’s awful but it is what it is. Point being, in any class, book or paper the terms (especially those that are not standardized) should be defined or it should be clear from the context."
What is derivative and how to interpret it,"“What is a derivative?”

*200 years of mathematicians arguing if you can split it*"
What is derivative and how to interpret it,"You’re actually right to pause and question that because you’re touching on something subtle but important. The derivative is the instantaneous rate of change at a specific point which tells you the slope of the tangent line to the curve at that point not what’s happening in the neighborhood overall but what the function is doing exactly at that spot.

So for f(x) = x³ the derivative is f ‘(x) = 3x² and when x = 0 that derivative is zero which means the tangent line at that point is flat. But that doesn’t mean the function isn’t increasing overall it just means that for a split second the rate of increase levels out before rising again. Imagine a skateboarder rolling up the bottom of a U-shaped ramp right at the lowest point their speed is momentarily zero even though they’re transitioning from going down to going up. Same for x³ at zero it’s still an increasing function but the rate of increase bottoms out right at x = 0

It’s that moment where change pauses even though the direction stays the same"
What is derivative and how to interpret it,"The verbal definition I had to chant like a cult member in undergrad was...

It is the:
(1) Instantaneous rate of change...

and 

(2) Point tangent to a line on a curve...

for a function.

---

(1) Describes the rate at which the function changes with respect to the independent variable(s).
(2) One can reconstruct the tangent line on any arbitrary curve knowing the derivative of that function at a point on the curve.

For your example, indeed the rate of change of x^3 at zero is zero. You are examining the rate at which the point 0 changes, which it doesn't, so it is zero. Stepping 1 unit in the positive direction, you'll find that the point f(1) changes at a rate of 3 units. At zero, reconstructing the tangent line shows that the slope of that line is zero."
What is derivative and how to interpret it,"Imagine the function of x\^3 was one of time, where x is in seconds. If you look at two points, like x=1 and x=2, you can see that this interval is 1 second long. If you look at a singular point, in this case x = 0 seconds, the amount of time this single point actually takes up is zero. So even though the derivative is 0 at this point, it is zero for no amount of time at all. Thus as the derivative is 0 for no amount of time, the function stays constant for no amount of time.

If you select any two different points however, two point with a higher x will always have a higher y value, which is the definition of strictly increasing."
What is derivative and how to interpret it,"f(x) is not increasing at 0, but it is still strictly increasing because if you increase x *to any other point* the value of f(x) would increase. It doesn't increase at 0 but it's the other point (and the points in the middle) that make it increase."
What is derivative and how to interpret it,One alternative framework originally due to caratheodory  but which I first encountered with Grant Sanderson is that the derivative is how much the function shrinks or stretchs inputs in a very smal interval so for a derivative to be 0 means that it would shrink all of space to a point. Or given that were discussing an injective function so it cant actually shrink space to a point that every shrink factor sees too big at some small enough scale.
What is derivative and how to interpret it,"I think your hangup might be the following misconception: ""If a function is always changing, then its rate of change should never be zero"".

If you think this is true, then you would clearly also think that a strictly increasing function should never have a derivative of 0, since strictly increasing functions are always changing. So let's find an example where the original misconception is easier identified as wrong.

Imagine you throw a ball upwards. Its height can be considered as a function of time. Clearly, the ball's position is always changing. There is no stretch in time where it just hovers at a specific height. Not even at its highest point, because once it reaches that point it immediately begins falling down.

Now consider the derivative of the height. At the start during the upwards motion it must be positive, but getting smaller with time as the ball is slowed down. During the downwards fall, the derivative is negative, and increasingly so as the ball is accelerated downwards. But if the derivative is first positive, and then negative, then it must have been zero at some point. That's at the highest point. This is a standard concept in calculus: At a maximum, we have derivative zero for exactly this reason.

So this ball is *always* changing its position, but it still has one point in time where its velocity is zero because it has to become zero somewhere between being positive and then becoming negative. So this shows that as long as the derivative is only zero at an isolated point, the function can still always be changing. And this applies to a function like x^3 as well. It's constantly changing (specifically, it's always increasing), but there is one single point where its derivative is zero. As long as it's just one point and not a whole interval, that doesn't matter."
What is derivative and how to interpret it,"simple answer: no, it shouldn't. your intuition is wrong."
What is derivative and how to interpret it,"From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonic_function#In_calculus_and_analysis), ""In calculus, a function 
f defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic if it is either entirely non-decreasing, or entirely non-increasing.  That is, as per Fig. 1, a function that increases monotonically does not exclusively have to increase, it simply must not decrease.""

It's interesting, though. If your definition was that the function *had* to increase you would still find y=x^3 a bit of a judgement call. For example if I challenged you to find two x values that shared the same y value you would be unable to. The gradient of y=x^3 is only zero at *exactly* x=0. There is no (non-zero) real number k such that (0+k)^(3)=0."

How to explore math as a dropout?,"Most math is useful when you understand the context of why we even discovered it in the first place. Almost everything has an application somewhere. But to your point, well, no one can help if they don't know what level you're at. You don't get to see the truly beautiful applications of mathematics towards fields like data and cs and finance until you get to classes like lin alg and probability. 

One thing about math is that it trains your ability to think. To be truly great at something, you must be at the intersection between memorization/knowledge of the domain, and being able to analyze something critically. Let's take an example of leetcode or DS&A. You need to have some things memorized to be good at leetcode. That is just fundamentally true. You can have all the problem solving skills in the world, but you aren't going to derive the formula for bubble sort in a 30 minute interview. But, if you do have that core knowledge, then being able to think critically on how to apply it to the problem in front of you is super useful. That's a skill math helps to develop. Almost any field out there looks for people who are really good at problem solving. That's why math can be so great-it helps you to analyze problems."

Quartic roots of complex numbers,"You have the right ideas.  Try drawing a picture.  Let's say you're solving


z^(4) = a


where a = 16 - i 16sqrt(15).  You've found that the complex number a can also be written as 


a = 64 exp[-i arctan(sqrt(15)] 


If we have 


z^(4) = r exp(it) 


Then we can use periodicity of the complex exponential to say


z^(4) = r exp[i(t + 2pi k)] 


So you have 


z^4 = 64 exp[i(-arctan(sqrt(15)) + 2pi k) ] 


for any integers k. 


Taking fourth roots on both sides (using the real positive root of 64) gives us


z = 2sqrt(2) exp[i (-arctan(sqrt(15))/4 + k pi/2) ] 


Where k is any integer.  Let k run through integers 0, 1, 2... until you get repeats and you're done.  This is where the picture drawing comes in.  You should see a very familiar shape emerge if you plot these for a few values of k. 


DeMoivre is just my last step rewritten with sines and coziness.  Nothing wild.

Linear Algebra...,"I recommend watching the series on YouTube called The Essence of Linear Algebra. You can find it on the channel 3blue1brown.

I recommend not trying to find something ""concrete"" in mathematical definitions. If you get used to the abstraction of definitions, it will be easier to understand more complex mathematical concepts.

A vector space is nothing more than a set in which the addition of two vectors (elements of the vector space) remains within the vector space, and the multiplication of a vector by a scalar from the field over which the vector space is defined also produces an element still within the vector space. The internal addition operation of the vector space has the properties of an Abelian group, which is very useful for various reasons (the existence of a neutral element for addition, commutativity, associativity, etc.).  

A subspace is a vector space that must contain the neutral element of the vector space of which it is a subset.  

Linear dependence and independence can be identified in multiple ways in practice, some more convenient than others, but you don’t need to know them all (though, of course, the more methods you know, the easier it is to choose the most suitable one for a given situation).  

My advice is to write down the definitions that don’t fully convince you on a sheet of paper and discuss them with your professor or tutor."
Linear Algebra...,It seems like you're struggling with the concept of defining things in terms of axioms. A vector space is defined to be a collection of things that act in a certain way.
Linear Algebra...,"It’s a generalization of R^n with its standard addition and scalar multiplication. A vector then is just an element of a vector space—by itself, not a very helpful statement, but can be thought of as an element of a space where things can be added and scaled and combined “linearly”."
Linear Algebra...,"The way to understand a definition is to apply it to examples.

When you think about vector spaces, the first mental image that should come to mind is ℝ³, which you might've learned about in physics class. In this context, ""vectors"" are lists of 3 coordinates, and you add them together by adding corresponding coordinates. You can also think about these same vectors as pointy arrows, and you add them together by putting them tip-to-tail. 

This is all that ""vector"" used to mean. In physics, it still often does mean just this.

So, when you read the definition of a vector space, think of this. Check that all the properties hold. Most of them should be pretty obvious, barely requiring any thought. Like, of *course* there's a vector where adding it to something doesn't change the result: it's just [0,0,0]. And of *course* adding vectors a+b is the same as b+a: you can see this both [visually](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ParallelogramLaw.html) and algebraically ( [a₁,a₂,a₃] + [b₁,b₂,b₃] = [a₁+b₁, a₂+b₂, a₃+b₃] = [b₁+a₁, b₂+a₂, b₃+a₃] = [b₁,b₂,b₃] + [a₁,a₂,a₃] ).

If these statements seem obvious, it's because they are! If you don't see anything special about them, you aren't missing anything. The key is what we can do *next*.

---

These statements are *also* true if, instead of talking about pointy arrows or lists of numbers, you're talking about *functions* ℝ→ℝ. You can add two functions pointwise [if you have functions f and g, then f+g is the function that takes in an input x, and gives you back f(x)+g(x) ], and you can scale them the same way [k·f is the function that takes in an input x, and gives you back k·f(x)]. So this means that a bunch of the things you learn about these arrows can *also* be applied to functions!

Each of these is a vector space:

- ℝ itself [adding is just adding, scaling is multiplication]
- ℂ, the set of complex numbers
- ℝⁿ: sequences of n elements [add corresponding coordinates; scale by multiplying all coordinates by your scale factor]
- the set of functions ℝ→ℝ [add pointwise, scale all outputs together]
- the set of *polynomials* in a single variable x

So when you talk about vector spaces, it's helpful to have ℝⁿ as your main example in your head. But if you prove things with *just* the axioms, suddenly you get a bunch of statements that apply to all these other things as well!

And it turns out this is useful to do: for instance, it turns out the solution set to certain types of differential equations is *always a subspace* of the set of functions. If you add two of these solutions, you get another solution; if you scale one up by a constant, you get another solution. So having this idea of a 'subspace' will be useful for other things."
Linear Algebra...,"Use friedberg’s book he explains theorems in a very clear way, you can also look at David lay’s book linear algebra and its applications"
Linear Algebra...,"I think that it's a very common phenomenon for people who take Linear Algebra for things to get tough around that point, because you are right that the amount of abstraction shoots up pretty fast.  Do you use a textbook for the course?"
Linear Algebra...,"There are 2 or 3 places in a mathematics education that I call ""breaks"" - places where you are floating along, everything seems to be going well, you understand everything nicely, and then suddenly they hit you over the head with a bunch of abstractions that just don't seem to make sense at all.

Calculus is one - probably more of a minor one.  Concepts like differentiation, integration, and limits are fundamentally different that anything you likely encountered before.

Now you have hit a second one: The abstraction of linear algebra.  Instead of just ""here are some rules for how to multiply matrices and calculate determinants"" it is suddenly ""Here is a whole abstract mathematical system based on these axioms"".

This is so different from how you (and most people) are used to thinking about things that it is a real difficult point for many people.

The third major ""break"" that hits math majors is when you have your first class that revolves around proofs rather than a bunch of problems you need to solve.

Others have given good advice about how to get your head around the definitions, axioms, and abstractions - what a vector space is, and all that. But sometimes it is helpful just to understand that *this really is a difficult spot, many others struggle with it for the same reasons, it is a big conceptual leap and a major increase in the level of abstraction, and it is very much OK if it takes you a while to get your head around all the concepts*.

Also, I will say that there are two major benefits if you *can* get your head around them:

 \- The whole idea of vectors, vector spaces, and associated concepts are very, very, VERY practically useful in many fields

 \- Beyond that, learning how to deal with abstractions of this type is very powerful in itself.  The whole of modern mathematics is built on this type of foundation.  So if you can 'crack the code' - even at just a very basic level - it opens up a lot of potential understanding in mathematics that is not otherwise available.

So keep at it - you may not see the reason or purpose behind it now, but if you keep at it, you will!"
Linear Algebra...,"What is a vector space (over a field)? Learn the definition. It's a set V endowed with two operations that satysfies a list of axioms. That's what it is. Those axioms come after you abstract how R^(n) behaves. Namely, you can add two things and get a thirdx and you can also multiply one creature in the vector space a by a number and get another creature in the vector space. 

What is a vector? Plain and simple, a vector is an element of a vector space. That's why there are different kinds of vectors. Polinomials are vectors. Matrices are vectors. Functions are vectors. Solutions to differential equations are vectors. And more...

When is something linearly independent? Learn the definition. If you think of vectors in R³ as arrows, linear independence means that the intersection of those vectors is the zero vector. 

When is something linearly dependent? Again, learn the definition, but broadly speaking it's when it's not linearly independent. For example, in R² two vectors are linearly dependent when they are contained in the same line. If you call your vectors u and v, that means that you can get one by scaling the other. So, you can write v = au, for some scalar a. 

My advice: learn the definitions first the way they are. See examples that ilustrate those definitions and use them. That way you'll remember them and yoy won't have those questions in your head"
Linear Algebra...,"Yeh.. That sounds about right. We do end up remembering all of the details because linear algebra shows up everywhere, you keep using it so it stays in your head.

Also, this is just the first example you see of a set that is closed under certain operations, there are a whole bunch of them and they are all very useful. Think of a vector space as a restriction on what you can usually do in an equation.

Like, numbers (fields) are amazing in the sense that you are able to manipulate them with great flexibility to solve very complex equations. So if whatever your working with behaves like a number (field) then you're golden. However, sometimes what you are working with does not act like a number at all. In that case you still want to put it in an equation and solve, but it's a bit less flexible. That is what you are currently learning how to de. 

As always, watch the 3blue1brown series on linear algebra. He truly is the great educator of our time. I cannot stress enough how lucky you are that this series exists and that you are able to watch it while learning linear algebra."
Linear Algebra...,"A vector space is a place where you can add and scale things, and addition and scaling behave nicely (as set out in the more formal definition).  
When we say ""the vector v is linearly independent to the vectors x and y"" what we mean is ""no amount of adding and scaling you can do to x and y will ever get you v""  
For example, x and y might be ""one step forwards"" and ""one step to the left"", and v could be ""one step up""  
No amount of stepping forwards and to the left, taking bigger or smaller steps, is ever gonna result in you hovering half a metre up in the air."

Once you manage that, take a final timed mock exam (under exam conditions) with the most recent, unknown paper. Prove to yourself your peparations even work with unknown questions -- if they do, you are as prepared as you can possibly be."
College math is starting to feel impossible,"Hi! As someone who just started to study a difficult topic that makes me bang my head on my desk for a month now, I feel like I might have some words that might make you feel better.

But before the advice part I actually want to ask you a few things. You say that you tackled some problems but had to look at the solution after working on them. Do you try to solve it again from scratch or do you just pass the question right after looking at the solution? This is literally the way you'll learn how to connect the dots yourself, so I strongly suggest you solve all of the exercises on your own without looking at the solutions. Intuition rarely comes from birth, so you have to train it by thinking on new information you've gained. 

Also, please don't have prejudice against the topics. You seeing the topic as an insurmountable obstacle will only make it worse for you. I always approach such topics like ''Other people before me managed to develop this topic so much and literally created ways for me to approach it, so why not try?'' If I fail the first time, I try again, and again, and again.... The human brain is such a marvelous thing that adapts to almost anything, so I'm sure that at some point, you'll be able to develop the necessary intuition to understand the problems you are facing. It might take a LOT of time, it is a hard journey, but it is almost always worth it in the end. So never give up OP, you can do it! If you have any more questions, please feel free to comment and I'll try my best to help!"
College math is starting to feel impossible,"I'll give you this one piece of anecdotal support. I got a minor in math, and calculus 2 was the hardest math class I took. Very closely followed by differential equations, but calculus 3 was way easier, linear algebra was way easier, and even non-euclidean geometry was way easier. If you make it through Calc 2, I'm pretty sure you're over the hump. :)"
College math is starting to feel impossible,"Just wanted to let you know that some textbooks are poorly written, others are harder to understand than they should be as they are basically reference books or are written for math students already familiar with the material.  it's always good to supplement your material with other book recommendations. I recently pulled out a college textbook to a chapter i once failed years ago (I passed the class) only to find a serious error in the algorithm that was described (it was the 3rd edition of a 20 year old book) no excuse for this to get past the editors but it did.  There were other badly written chapters too with poor explanations (it's more common than you think).  I trashed it. sometimes you think the problem is you, not the text book, when in reality its the book."
College math is starting to feel impossible,"I feel you bro. I'm a freshman engineering student and was always ""good"" at math in high school (I got a 97 in my calc BC class junior year) and decided to start college taking calc II since I already did most of it once and thought it would be easy. It was a complete slap in the face and my worst grade last semester. I'm now taking linear algebra and have no idea what's going on 80% of the time. 

  
so far though some things that I've learned help are Symbolab (helps on homework), ChatGPT (SOME of the time is very good at explaining, others it gets stuff completely wrong) and obviously yt vids like organic chemistry tutor. I used to spend hours on a single problem because I was determined to figure it out, but much of the time to no avail. It's important to not waste your time because if you don't know how to solve something after 20 minutes, the chances are, you just won't be able to on your own. Go ask friends and go to office hours when you are completely confused.

  
Also, sometimes it's just not your fault. Many math teachers are so smart that they know the content so well they could write a textbook on it, but they have trouble conveying it. Don't beat yourself up when you're confused, because the chances are, everyone else is too ;)

  
Just keep grinding out practice problems and eventually, stuff will click. Trust."
College math is starting to feel impossible,"it’s like you’re doing everything you’re supposed to and still feel like you’re sinking, not swimming. and when people say “just practice more” it honestly feels like a slap in the face, cuz you are practicing. for hours. but it’s not clicking, and that’s what eats at you. it’s not laziness, it’s that dread of feeling like your brain just doesn’t wire the way everyone else’s seems to.

but here’s the thing this doesn’t mean you’re not cut out for math or physics. it probably just means you’re stuck in that brutal no-man’s-land between knowing the tools and knowing when to use them. and that transition sucks. it’s slow. it feels like trying to juggle with oven mitts on. and honestly? everyone who gets through this stage remembers it as one of the hardest parts.

intuition in math is a weird beastit’s not magic, it’s pattern recognition built on a mountain of failures. like, failing forward. and sometimes just doing more problems isn’t the fixit’s how you’re unpacking them. like… when you check a solution, are you just going “ah okay i see what they did there” and moving on? or are you sitting with it, asking why this step worked, what clue pointed to using this method, what would’ve triggered that move in your own head?

sometimes we practice problems like we’re trying to brute force a lock, but what you need is a way to listen for the clicks. slow it down. narrate your thinking out loud. ask yourself at each step “what do i know right now? what tools could work? what’s the goal?” even if you’re wrong, that internal dialogue is what starts building that intuition.

you said you’re working on foundationsgood. don’t skip that. it’s not backtracking, it’s building better scaffolding. and honestly, passing at all under this pressure? that’s not nothing. you’re not failing, you’re just not winning yet.

you’re not broken. you’re in the middle of learning something truly hard. but it’s doable. one painful, frustrating, slow insight at a time. and if you want help breaking down specific problems or talking through how to study differently, i’m here for that too. this doesn’t have to be solo."
College math is starting to feel impossible,"Some words of encouragement: 

I'm terrible at math and trying to get better as an adult. I accepted that I'm ""not a math person"" years ago, but I related this sentiment to my wife, whose undergrad is in mathematics and she rejected the idea outright. 

She basically said that, yes, math can be hard, and it was hard for her. Getting that math degree required lots of studying, and struggling, and going to office hours whenever she could and putting in tons of effort. She often felt like others were just naturally gifted and she was dragging behind everyone. But she just put in the work and kept going. 

So the encouragement is basically that, yes, it's hard, but that doesn't mean you are wrong for pursuing it! The stoics would tell you that the obstacle IS the way. So keep at it, and don't worry about others.

 Remember: your professors are being paid to help you learn math. Make sure they're doing their job, even if you have lots of questions. Others in the room probably have the same one, but are embarrassed about asking. Don't assume because your professor has a degree and knows the subject they are teaching it well. If it's confusing, ask questions! I'm now speaking as a teacher (middle and high school) and I let all of my students know education is a two way street. My job is to do my best to transmit information, and their job is to do their best to receive it. But that means it's their responsibility to let me know if things don't make sense. Just because I'm sending information doesn't mean it's a perfect lesson, and if they don't get it, I haven't done my job! But if they don't let me know they don't get it, I'm not going to try a different approach!

So, work hard, ask questions, and embrace the challenge! Good luck!"
College math is starting to feel impossible,"It’s difficult to say what your problem is without knowing the situation. It’s not supposed to be easy. How many hours are you putting into your studies?

Studying with others can be very helpful for some, maybe try to get together a study group.

Practice really is king. Do the problems, but also study the solutions carefully. If you don’t understand email your profs or lecturer or talk to them during problem classes. 

Intuition is something you have to build. It will come with time if you put in the effort. But maybe there are also gaps in your background knowledge that you need to address? Again, I wouldn’t know

Do you have an academic advisor or something? You could go to them for advice, that’s what they’re for."
College math is starting to feel impossible,"Honestly I like to complain about math a lot, bashing the study materials and examples in the Discord server of our uni usually works wonders.

Someone always pops up with a magical youtube channel, piece of advice regarding their approach to studying, understanding the topic, sometimes they share the solution and thought processes behind it…

And then I press the start button on my brain and think about what it is that I don’t understand. Formulate it into questions, dig for answers, abuse ChatGPT, watch all the cool videos on YT, think more, get to the root of my poor understanding and nip it in the bud.

If you let 5 lectures pass you by without understanding them, oh boy is it gonna snowball!"
College math is starting to feel impossible,"You might benefit from seeing a tutor who can criticize your technique in real time. Having not done a lot of math, maybe you're missing some steps in the problem solving process.
But my first thought is, like... it's supposed to be hard. You're struggling but still passing, that's the ideal difficulty level, right? It'd be bad if you totally didn't get it, and it'd be bad in a different way if you knew it all already. Try to step back and recognize the progress you're making; what can you do today that you couldn't do a couple months ago? Things can be both stressful and going well at the same time."

College math is starting to feel impossible,"Time spent working with a good private tutor would *really* help here.  Lot's of people work for an hour or two with a tutor for literally every assignment at this level.  If you're working with a good tutor, it can make a huge difference in precisely the areas where you are having trouble: A good tutor will help you figure out why and how you are wasting so much time, and in developing better strategies to hone in on the right path to solutions.

A good tutor can literally make the difference between doing well in these courses and failing miserably.

You should be able to find tutors by asking around the math department, checking bulletin boards there, and so on.  Many upper class math majors and grad students spend a lot of time tutoring."
College math is starting to feel impossible,"*> tons of practice was the way to go*

Practice is indeed important and necessary, but practice *doing the wrong thing* is counterproductive. 

If you just do the wrong thing over and over, or different wrong things, you are literally training yourself to do the wrong thing.

Say you were a violinist and though think ""Lots of practice is what I need to be good!\~!!!1!!"" 

But then when you practice, 90% of the notes are wrong, and you play different wrong notes every time you play for hours on end.

Is your practice making you *better* or *worse*?

You have a performance and you discover that you played even more than 90% wrong notes - because performances always go just the way you practice, but usually a little worse due to pressure, nerves, and so on.

So . . . it is *exactly* the same with your math practice.

Practice is helpful.  But you have to be *practicing the right thing* not just randomly flailing around.

Again, I think getting with a good tutor will help you the most right now.  Because they will be able to get into your process as you work to solve these problems, figure out where that is going wrong, and steer you towards productive methods.

*Those* are what you need to practice.  Just flailing and flailing and flailing around, ineffectively and endlessly, isn't going to help or make you better."

College math is starting to feel impossible,"Hi OP, not sure if you'll see this, but I really struggled in my undergrad math major until I hired a tutor who was a math PhD student. I paid $20/hour a few hours per week and it got me through my undergrad degree. Math is hard and sometimes you need the extra help. I know it might be hard to afford that cost, but for what it's worth I worked in restaurants to afford it. My first college algebra midterm I got a D, second midterm I got a B+.

College math is starting to feel impossible,"Not a suggestion, but just food for thought. I did a math major and most of my upper level class exams were 1 or 2 problems and I spent all 3 hours of that quiz time doing it. Don't think I solved the problems half the time, but I still passed the classes. The attempt is the learning. 

You're able to have ideas on how to solve a problem for 3 hours, able to show the process and steps you used, and maybe you didn't find a solution. That's OK. Math isn't about the solution, it's your algebraic reasoning and intuition. Reasoning you get from class, the intuition comes from time and practice. 

I don't know your math professors, but a lot of the time they are looking over your work for the strategies you used and not looking at the final answer."

"Im pretty screwed as I'm ""Homeschooled"" and I need help.","first off, it sounds like you're not bad at math at all, and it sounds like you might catch up just fine if you keep working for it.

i think in your situation it would be best to find out what exams you're going to take, and what you should learn for that. perhaps you can send an email to a local school? or if you have friends in school, ask them if you can contact their math teacher? they will probably better understand which course fits best.

that said, math is pretty universal, so it is unlikely that you'll learn the ''wrong'' things if you take the wrong course. so if you cannot find the ''correct'' answer, i'd just pick whichever course you think fits best and at least start there while you try to find the answer."
Returning to Math,"first off the fact that you’re starting again is already a win and more than most people are willing to do coming back to math after 10 years is hard not because you’re not smart but because confidence takes a hit when your brain hasn’t flexed those muscles in a while

you’re right that Khan Academy is great for brushing up but once you get past the early grade levels it can feel like it’s holding your hand too much and not really pushing your thinking the way actual precalc or trig problems will

here’s how you can level it up a bit

start using Paul’s Online Math Notes especially his Algebra and Precalculus sections it’s free and feels more like a real college prep experience than Khan’s early levels he walks through the logic clearly and gives you problems that match actual class rigor

also check out OpenStax Precalculus online free full textbook used in real colleges it’s got explanations examples and most importantly practice problems that aren’t watered down you can even just download the PDF and work from that like a workbook

if you want something physical on Amazon search for Schaum’s Outlines series especially Precalculus and Trigonometry these aren’t flashy books but they are packed with examples and problems with answers and they’re designed for self-study

and don’t skip geometry and trig as their own subjects if your program calls them out trig identities and right triangle logic trip people up more than they expect and that stuff shows up everywhere in precalc and calc"

Multiplication with decimals breaks my brain,"Area isn't represented in cm - it's represented in cm^(2). Converting from cm^(2) to m^(2) requires dividing by 10,000 cm^(2)/m^(2). Consider a 1m x 1m square. It has 100 cm per side. How many 1cm x 1 cm squares are there? (10,000)"
Multiplication with decimals breaks my brain,"Remember area is in m^2 or cm^2, not m or cm. 1 m² isn’t equal to 100 cm². If you have a 1 m² square, that’s a 100 cm x 100 cm square, which is 10,000 cm²."
Multiplication with decimals breaks my brain,"1 m = 100 cm

1 m^(2)  
= 1^(2) m^(2)  
= (1 m)^(2)  
= (100 cm)^(2)  
= 100^(2) cm^(2)  
= 10 000 cm^(2)"
Multiplication with decimals breaks my brain,"Calculate it like this instead (treat `cm` as one variable name).

    A = 15.3cm * 7.4cm
    A = 15.3 * cm * 7.4 * cm
    A = 15.3 * 7.4 * cm * cm
    A = 15.3 * 7.4 * cm²
    A = 113.22 * cm²
    A = 113.22cm²
    A = 0.011322m²

(`1cm² = 0.0001m²`, as you need to divide twice by 100 (one for length and one for width))

In meters it comes to the same result:

    A = 0.153m * 0.074m
    A = 0.153 * m * 0.074 * m
    A = 0.153 * 0.074 * m * m
    A = 0.153 * 0.074 * m²
    A = 0.011322 * m²
    A = 0.011322m²"
Multiplication with decimals breaks my brain,"It's actually the square meters that's throwing you off. 

You're right that 15.3\*7.4 = 113.22, but it's not 113.22 cm; it's 113.22 cm². 

And that is not 1.1322 m². With square meters, you actually divide by 100² or 10,000.

So 113.22 cm² = (113.22/10000) m² = 0.011322 m². 

But it's good that you're questioning the process. That's how we learn."
Multiplication with decimals breaks my brain,"Another good piece of information if you convert decimals into easier to work with numbers by moving the decimal, know that's either multiplying by 10^k or dividing by 10^k. Because of this, you need to reverse it. 

So in your example you have 0.153 x 0.074. converting to cm is multiplying by 100 on both terms. So you now have 10^2 x 10^2 outstanding that you need to return if you go back to m^2 as your units.


So your 113.22 /10000 = 0.011322 m^2

A very helpful thing to learn for this is going through some dimensional analysis. It helps you understand SI units and converting this piece is fully under that."
Multiplication with decimals breaks my brain,UNITS! 10cm^2 ≠ 10cm ≠(10cm)^2
Multiplication with decimals breaks my brain,"What you're doing well is keeping units during calculations, what you're doing poorly is not including them in operations. cm\*cm = cm^(2) ,  m^(2) =  100^(2) \* cm^(2)"
Multiplication with decimals breaks my brain,"You’re confusing length with area. If I have 10 cm x 10 cm that = 100 right? So does that then mean 1 metre? Box out a space with your hands that is 10cm by 10 cm, is that anywhere near a metre of anything?"

Simple question on combination/probability equation for game parlays,\# of outcomes is 2^(# of games). 2 outcomes for game 1\*2 outcomes for game 2\* … \*2 outcomes for game N. 
Simple question on combination/probability equation for game parlays,"The formula for the number of combinations is:

   \[number of outcomes per game\]\^\[number of games\]

An intuitive way to look at this is, for every possible outcome of 1 game, the following game has the same number of possible outcomes, each of which lead to their own set of possible outcomes in the following game, and so on. So, if there are *n* possible outcomes for each game, and *x* games, then for each game, there are *n* possible outcomes. Each of these outcomes start a separate combination. In the next game, there are also *n* possible outcomes, meaning that for each of the *n* outcomes of the original game, there are an additional *n* possible outcomes for the next game, or *n* ways to have a separate combination for each of the original *n* outcomes of the first game. This means that for 2 games, the number of combinations is n\*n, or n\^2. This can be continued for *x* games, where each game multiplies the number of combinations by *n*. Therefore, the total number of possible combinations is *n\*n\*...\*n* (where n is repeated *x* times). In other words, the number of combinations is *n*\^*x*."
question about a game,"Following. My only two cents is the strategy probably involves performing some form of equivalence partitioning between a and b, and picking successive midpoints between each partition so the target partition gets shorter and shorter. Eg. For 1-100, picking 50, 25, 12 ... 

I could be totally off base, hence following to see what actual answers could be."
question about a game,"Optimal strategy would depend on n.

E.g. Suppose the range is 0 to 100

For n=2, the second player will pick the neighbouring number on the larger side; if player 1 picks #85, say, then player 2 will pick #84. So player 1 will pick the central #50 to maximise the side not picked by player 2.

For n=3, if player 1 picks #50 then they'll get sandwiched by the other players picking #49 and #51, so they don't want to do that. Instead they'll pick a value off-centre enough that player 2 leaves enough gap that player 3 won't sandwich player 2."
Functions intersections with inverse,"Your friend is right, you could miss some solutions because the graphs of a function and its inverse might intersect elsewhere. 

For example, consider the function f:R->R defined as f(x)=-x. The inverse to this function is f^(-1)(x)=-x, namely it is its own inverse. So the graphs of f(x) and f^(-1)(x) intersect everywhere, not just on the line y=x."
Functions intersections with inverse,"Let's say I have some function where f(1) = 2 and f(2) = 1. Applying f^-1 to each of these equations we find f^-1 (f(1)) = 1 = f^-1 (2) and f^-1 (2) = 1. These are the same values as for f(x), so 1 and 2 would be a solution. I general any points where f(x) = y and f(y) = x will be solution to f(x) = f^-1 (x).


Now it is true that solutions to f(x) = x will always be solutions, but thisnis just the special case where x=y in the relationship above."

Optimizing in 2D with constraints - why are the gradients of the curve and the function linearly dependent in this case?,"The g(a,b) = 0 is only indirectly relevant here: the important bit is that any set of vectors that contains the zero vector is linearly dependent: if v = 0 then v = 0 w for every other vector w.

The g(a,b) = 0 ""only"" shows that g is a so-called ""active constraint"" at (a,b), which means that you actually have to care about grad g(a,b) when looking into linear (in-)dependence. If your constraint is g(x,y) <= 0 and you have some point (a,b) such that g(a,b) < 0 then the same is true for all points ""close to (a,b)"" by continuity. So intuitively the constraint ""doesn't constraint anything"" around (a,b) and hence it's irrelevant: a local solution without that constraint will be the same as the one with the contraint. On the other hand if g(a,b) = 0 then this is not true and you have to actually deal with that constraint in some way."
