How would you convince someone to learn math?,"I have a degree in Math and there‚Äôs been times where I‚Äôve found myself bored or drained of it. One thing that helped me personally get excited about it was focusing on the contextual aspect of math. Kind of like reading a story and wanting to know more about it. If I focused too much on just getting the work done somehow, it drained all my excitement but when I approached it with my curiosity, it helped me enjoy it and actually get better results with my work too. 

When it comes to what excites other people, I‚Äôve realized that fun math puzzles or theorems that get people thinking tend to be effective on getting them interested. You have to find a way to be curious about math. Math is a big puzzle waiting to be solved.","i have a degree in math and there‚Äôs been times where i‚Äôve found myself bored or drained of it. one thing that helped me personally get excited about it was focusing on the contextual aspect of math. kind of like reading a story and wanting to know more about it. if i focused too much on just getting the work done somehow, it drained all my excitement but when i approached it with my curiosity, it helped me enjoy it and actually get better results with my work too.

How did you even learn math in uni?,">but I just feel so dumb because I like maths.

What aspects of math do you actually enjoy?

I had to do calculus, linear algebra, and stats courses for computer science, and none of it was enjoyable.

I memorized formulas and techniques and used that to squeeze by. Fortunately, the exams didn't require me to apply my understanding of math to solve problems and only tested whether I can memorize things.

If you gave me a little math problem where you're optimizing budget or something, I'd probably enjoy it, but anything beyond that, like actual math, just puts me to sleep.",">but i just feel so dumb because i like maths.

The why of math rules.,"I've been there. I struggled with math as a kid, and just recently have realized I'm actually good at it. I'd ask the same questions. But I finally learned that the why isn't always helpful, because it can be so complex.

Math people can start talking and because they already understand what they are talking about, they often don't realize that it's just getting more confusing the more detail they give to us normal people. üòâ

Math is a language describing concepts and giving an abstract representation of something real. It's like using the word ""love"" to describe how you feel about someone. Obviously, we can go into the history of why we use the word love and the linguistics, but that doesn't help us understand the meaning. But once we have experienced love and relate the word to the experience, any time that word is used, we instantly understand what it means.

Math is the same way, but it's more difficult than language in some ways because language relates to words we already grasp the meaning of. Math describes concepts we need to understand; so we are learning a language and an idea at the same time. That's difficult to do. Add in anxiety and time pressure, and you have a lot of people give up and think they must be stupid.

Hopefully that clarified something.....","i've been there. i struggled with math as a kid, and just recently have realized i'm actually good at it. i'd ask the same questions. but i finally learned that the why isn't always helpful, because it can be so complex.

How to explore math as a dropout?,"Most math is useful when you understand the context of why we even discovered it in the first place. Almost everything has an application somewhere. But to your point, well, no one can help if they don't know what level you're at. You don't get to see the truly beautiful applications of mathematics towards fields like data and cs and finance until you get to classes like lin alg and probability. 

One thing about math is that it trains your ability to think. To be truly great at something, you must be at the intersection between memorization/knowledge of the domain, and being able to analyze something critically. Let's take an example of leetcode or DS&A. You need to have some things memorized to be good at leetcode. That is just fundamentally true. You can have all the problem solving skills in the world, but you aren't going to derive the formula for bubble sort in a 30 minute interview. But, if you do have that core knowledge, then being able to think critically on how to apply it to the problem in front of you is super useful. That's a skill math helps to develop. Almost any field out there looks for people who are really good at problem solving.

Relearning Math from the ground up,"Making the jump from ""being good at math classes"" to a math major is a pretty big one - so that's awesome.

Higher level mathematics is all about learning and understanding the definitions of vocabulary words, and having solid examples to match with the definitions.

After that, it becomes a matter of manipulating the definitions and using logic and experience to figure out what you can get away with.

Having a solid background in algebra will serve you well though.","making the jump from ""being good at math classes"" to a math major is a pretty big one - so that's awesome.

What should I take after Calc III,"It depends on what you want to do. Completing Calc 3 in what I'm assuming is high school (since you mentioned AP classes) is insane.

I think statistics is the most important math class that everyone should take. It comes up so often, and yet I'd bet that most American adults don't know what a mean, median, mode, and standard deviation are. Statistics are also very useful in science and engineering (e.g., quantum mechanics is basically fancy statistics). This should be easier than any calculus course.

Linear algebra is good for coding applications. I found it to be mechanically easy, but it can be difficult to conceptualize the meaning of things like dot products, determinants, or vector spaces. This is very useful for questions like ""how do I systematically solve many equations at once?"" Or ""how do I mess with the coordinates of an object to show that it turned?""

Differential equations is the next step after calculus. This is good for questions like ""how does temperature affect pressure?"" or ""how does the concentration of this chemical change as a reaction progresses?"" This is likely the most difficult class, but it should be a comparible difficulty to linear algebra. In fact, I took a class in college which was a combined Diff EQ and linear algebra class.

Serious: should I further learn math? Should I formally study it?,"I don't know what your career is right now, but i don't think going for a math degree is the best if that's your situation. I am studying physics at uni and the math you use is very strong and you constantly have to use it in real (or approximately real) problems. I love math and I actually don't believe every result we get if I don't understand the math behind it.

So as someone said in another comment, maybe a masters degree in math in some area that you can use in your job/other career is a good idea. Or maybe you can find another career like physics or some engineering degree where you can learn a lot of math and actually use it.

But also maybe you just enjoy knowing math things as a hobby. I love music and playing instruments but I never thought about doing a career in something related because I want it to be my hobby, a thing to enjoy that's not a responsibility. So maybe think about what role math has in your life and think about how you want to enjoy it too. 

Random story: 
The other day in a statistics class, our professor told us about a problem that appears when you extend the idea of probability to an infinite set of possible results, but the real problem was that you can't find in the real world a situation like this. It's true that there are problems with using the theory in these situations, but that just doesn't happen in real life, so his conclusion was that mathematicians are quite creative and sometimes they create problems that nobody has.

 If you don't care about super abstract ideas, look up something where you use math, instead of where you just learn it.","i don't know what your career is right now, but i don't think going for a math degree is the best if that's your situation. i am studying physics at uni and the math you use is very strong and you constantly have to use it in real (or approximately real) problems. i love math and i actually don't believe every result we get if i don't understand the math behind it.

How do you solve problems?,"A mathematician studies by building a deep understanding of the ideas and then working on many problems while checking their work against known results and theorems. When you work on problems by yourself, you can:

1. Learn the theory well by reading texts and lectures. Use clear examples to see how abstract concepts work. For example, Polya‚Äôs method in ""How to Solve It"" teaches breaking a problem into smaller parts and testing ideas against known facts. 

2. Practice a lot with simpler exercises first. Even if the books don‚Äôt show solutions, try to verify your answers by comparing them with similar solved problems in other texts or online forums like Math StackExchange, where experts discuss methods. 

3. Seek feedback in multiple ways. You mentioned using a subreddit and a Discord channel. In these communities, you can share your solution methods and ask if your reasoning is sound. While direct feedback may be less immediate than in subjects like history, active discussion with peers helps improve your understanding.

4. Write out your solutions carefully. Then, check your work by verifying that each step follows logically and by testing special cases. This self-review is a key practice in research-level mathematics where feedback is often indirect.

5. Understand that mathematics is abstract and building insight takes time. A professional mathematician often collaborates with others and presents ideas in seminars or preprints, which provides more detailed feedback than solo study.

By combining deep study, deliberate practice, and active discussion with peers, you can develop the self-checking habits that professional mathematicians use. This approach, along with modern tools like AI agents and multi-modality resources (which can include interactive problem solvers or digital textbooks), helps in verifying your work. These methods, along with techniques such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for finding information, fine tuning your problem-solving strategies, and prompt engineering your learning queries, support a more productive self-study experience.

Galois Theory Humbled Me,"Abstract algebra has never really clicked for me. I can recall most definitions but the furthest in that direction I am generally willing to touch is operator algebras, due to the rather interesting connections to functional analysis. I am  far more comfortable working in all things analysis; I will stick through probability theory, differential equations, classical analysis, but algebra is simply not my thing. Perhaps I would have found it more intuitive if I sat through and tried to work through more problems, but I despised group theory pretty much from the beginning so I don't know feasible that would have been.

Also, I think suggesting intuition has a limit is somewhat misleading. Sure, some people are just naturally quick to pick up the ideas behind topics, but the general process involves a lot of grinding exercises and carefully reading proofs. It is simply not possible to remember all the important ideas in math without forcing yourself to interact with them in some way, and it is that process which builds up intuition. When I was exposed to analysis for the very first time it completely destroyed any sense of intuition I thought I had for calculus (see things like Thomae's function/Volterra's function to see just how ugly some analysis counterexamples can get), but I rebuilt it all from scratch eventually, with all the prior defects now fixed.

How was your experience studying Real Analysis?,"In the US, I took calculus 1 through 3, then took proofs and linear algebra, then took real analysis (technically only proofs and calc 2 were required for real analysis). At first, I didn't like it. I didn't understand the whole epsilon/delta stuff or how any of it worked. I didn't really understand what the epsilon and delta even meant. I complete understand that pain you're feeling now. However, I had a complete 180 when I took my second semester of it, where my instructor emphasized how awesome some of the unexpected results are. Like, yes every differentiable function is continuous, but every derivative *is not* continuous! That's crazy! Stuff like that is really cool. Then in grad school, I took measure theory and general topology. I really liked both of them, but I didn't like how measure theory felt so focused on only one measure (the Lebesgue measure) when there's so much theory about general measures, but I also struggled with how some topologies don't provide much to work with.

how to learn Calculus with ONLY geometry?,"If you want a book which details the ""geometric intuition"" behind a great deal of mathematics Roger Penrose's ""The Road to Reality: A complete guide to the laws of the universe"" starts with basic number systems and works up through calculus to the advanced math of vector spaces and  manifolds.

It is not a math or physics textbook. You are unlikely to fully learn calculus from the book BUT I faced similar math struggles and I now understand the *purpose* and *behavior* of a ton of math and because the symbolic math is also presented you get a better feel for how equations act like a balance scale around the equals sign and how items of the left ""balance each other"". 

Don't get the electronic version as equation formatting is broken at times. 

This is a 1000+ page book. It is a *lifetime* learning book not meant to be read cover to cover.  Read first several chapters until you get lost. Then go to chapter you are interested in and try reading that. It will have many cross-links like ""as described in section 2.2‚Äù so when you don't understand you go to that section and learn more. 

Penrose is one of the few modern physics/math people who still stresses geometry in an age where pure math is preferred.  Much advanced math, especially involving complex numbers, has a strong geometric underpinning so it makes sense to learn it from both pure and geometric approaches.

And a tip: 

Differential equations are at core just a more detailed way to deal with ""slope"" in simple Cartesian geometry, the rate of change or ""how steep"" a line is. This means, loosely speaking, any time you see a derivative like dx/dt it is talking about how fast x changes as time evolves.

Edit: I forgot to add this is a *lifetiem* learning book. It is *intimidating* and overwhelming but it is the only single0-book I've ever found to provide *visual* explanations for the math *and* for my physics work he teaches the pros and cons of various mathematical approaches to various types of problems. 

And the price is under $25, which is way cheaper than most textbooks and if you like math ... there are more kinds of math in that book than most advanced mathematicians and/or phycisist will every learn.

Udemy courses with 10 min videos to learn advanced math up to topology?,"There's a split in mathematics between *practical* mathematics and *theoretical* mathematics, with the second one sometimes breezily called *higher* mathematics. And theoretical mathematics offers a huge challenge for online education. At present, we are only getting faint glimmers of how to teach theoretical mathematics without hands-on instruction.

The two parts have very different vibes, and getting used to the theoretical math style of thinking is a big challenge for a lot of students. It's a big conceptual shift. Practical math is about getting *an answer*, and it's fairly easy for a machine to check if an answer is right. But theoretical math is about *proving things*, and until recently machines have been very bad at telling whether a proof was right.

Just to help you get your bearings: all of high school mathematics except some topics in geometry are ""practical"" math. Practical also includes most of calculus. The boundary runs right through the middle of linear algebra and also through differential equations (though a whole lot of differential equations is practical). A lot of complex analysis (the part that is really a branch of calculus) is also practical.

But almost all the topics from there on use the theoretical style: abstract algebra, real analysis, topology, number theory, algebraic geometry, differential geometry, a whole lot of computer science (though CS has a big important practical area, of course), and so on and on.

Online educators face an enormous challenge when trying to teach theoretical topics like topology. I think we will get there eventually using proof-verifying software like LEAN and Coq; the ""Natural Number Game"" at [https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/leanprover-community/nng4](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/leanprover-community/nng4) is an early glimpse of what that kind of learning might be like. And that's just for the very basics of integer analysis; we are just not there yet with real analysis, abstract algebra, or topology. But maybe the story will be different ten years from now.","there's a split in mathematics between *practical* mathematics and *theoretical* mathematics, with the second one sometimes breezily called *higher* mathematics. and theoretical mathematics offers a huge challenge for online education. at present, we are only getting faint glimmers of how to teach theoretical mathematics without hands-on instruction.

I get that that's a bit weird, but it's also pretty key.

Math is trying to tell you something, it's trying to describe something -- usually a pattern or a relationship.

Forcing yourself to grunt through the formalism and manipulation of symbols without understanding what that is underlying pattern or relationship is will always seem disconnected and arbitrary.

But if you understand that pattern/relationship and you know how math is related, then finding the solution (if indeed you actually need a specific solution) will be easier.",">""its not about memorizing how to do it, its about understanding the concept""¬†- what does that even mean?

Fundamentals and understanding! Memorizing math is the road to math Hell, paved with good math intentions but ultimately headed towards math punishment! You must go to textbook problems, and do them!

If you must use them, only for hints and to check work. If you don‚Äôt get the same answer, don‚Äôt copy!).

Office. Hours. Professors love to see you in office hours. It‚Äôs a whole thing. Come with your homework questions, leave with your homework answers and sometimes a bonus hint for the next test.

to be honest there is only way to get good at math, especially if it doesn‚Äôt naturally click for you.

study more!

i hobbled through college and got a chemical engineering degree. when the business degrees were partying, i studied. when the science degrees were sleeping, i studied. when the arts degrees were having sex‚Ä¶. well i played some rpgs. i needed a break eventually!

fundamentals and understanding! memorizing math is the road to math hell, paved with good math intentions but ultimately headed towards math punishment! you must go to textbook problems, and do them! resist the cheat hw answers that will inevitably be passed around (seriously, i saw some dudes get kicked out. those things always end up having at least one error. if you must use them, only for hints and to check work. if you don‚Äôt get the same answer, don‚Äôt copy!).

office. hours. professors love to see you in office hours. it‚Äôs a whole thing. come with your homework questions, leave with your homework answers and sometimes a bonus hint for the next test.

Can I become good?,"Math is a learnable skill, and like any discipline, with study and practice, you can become much better at it and appreciate it more.

If you aren't that good/comfortable doing math, start by reviewing/ re-learning some basic math -- even as far back as fractions, percentages, graphing, basic algebra, geometry.  You might find that you understand things better at age 22 than at age 12!

There are lots of videos and tutorials online, but also see if you can find a way to do math with other people (a study group, tutoring, friends...).  Talking about it, working on problems together -- these really help you learn.  And it's more interesting and social than solitary studying.   It might even be... fun!

Struggled in Discrete Math -- Was it a lack of talent or just poor mindset (or both)?,"Discrete math is *supposed* to do that to most people. It's most students' first foray into real abstraction and proof-based constructions of anything. It's not like other classes that are heavily calculation-based where you can put some formulas in your tool bag as starting points and then rely on being good at algebra (see: most ""gifted"" students' first forays into calculus I and II). Obviously it's disappointing to fail, but that doesn't mean it's over for you. Whether it's one problem at a time or one course at a time, learning new things is supposed to challenge you and you'll fail eventually. You're making a big deal philosophizing about your self-worth for something that's... pretty normal.

Discrete math, more than any math class you've taken before, will require doing the thing yourself. You don't have proof muscles like you have algebra muscles; just following along with the book or lecture notes isn't going to be enough. You've got to be an active participant to develop your skills to the point where certain steps can become trivial.

Some programming experience made me feel like Proofs was a lot easier than some of my classmates (my school called it proofs, but it's the same idea). With a taste for what the course is like, a more active approach to studying, and the programming course under your belt, you'll probably do just fine if you take it again.","discrete math is *supposed* to do that to most people. it's most students' first foray into real abstraction and proof-based constructions of anything. it's not like other classes that are heavily calculation-based where you can put some formulas in your tool bag as starting points and then rely on being good at algebra (see: most ""gifted"" students' first forays into calculus i and ii). obviously it's disappointing to fail, but that doesn't mean it's over for you. whether it's one problem at a time or one course at a time, learning new things is supposed to challenge you and you'll fail eventually. you're making a big deal philosophizing about your self-worth for something that's... pretty normal.

why is algebra 1/math so hard for me,"Math is a tricky subject.  I think it would help to understand where you're having trouble.  Are you not understanding concepts?  Now knowing where to begin on a problem? Or just keep coming up with the wrong answer?  Without knowing how you're struggling, it's hard to know how to help.

I will say that you might want to check out YouTube channels like [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown) if you're having a problem understanding the concepts -- I know algebra is typically taught as a very abstract topic, and having nice animated visuals to go along with the algebra topics can make some concepts just ""click"" 

If you're just making dumb mistakes on your work (which is why you should show your work), then I have a few suggestions, but it ultimately just comes down to attention to detail.  One of the biggest things that helped for me was getting rid of all subtraction and division, and replace them with ""adding a negative"" and ""multiplying by the reciprocal"" respectively.  For example, instead of 10 - x, you do 10 + (-x) to enforce the idea that the minus goes with the x.

And finally, most math textbooks include a ""sheet sheet"" of formulas, rules, etc. on the inside of one of the covers.  Refer to it while you're doing your homework to reinforce the basics.","math is a tricky subject.  i think it would help to understand where you're having trouble.  are you not understanding concepts?  now knowing where to begin on a problem? or just keep coming up with the wrong answer?  without knowing how you're struggling, it's hard to know how to help.

"I‚Äôm a teenager, but was never given a proper education. How do I teach myself?","I'd google search, for example, ""high school cirriculum"" or ""secondary school cirriculum"" and also make use of libre texts (free textbooks online including high school and college level material).

[https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Algebra](https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Algebra)

Pick a book, read a section, and then try to solve the problems. Self learning can be difficult. If you're not sure you're doing a problem correctly you can use youtube (people give step-by-step solutions to similar problems) or kahn academy (which I've had mixed results with, but maybe there is some excellent algebra stuff on it).

Note that in school you don't typically cover every section, and even in the sections you do cover, students aren't required to solve every problem. If you can solve the first few problems of each type in each section you'd be doing well. Also note that although that link shows many textbooks, there is a lot of overlap between beginner/intermediate/advanced algebra.  You really only need to work though 1 or 2 books in the way I described (doing a few problems of each type).

But anyway, for the overall structure, look online for high school / secondary school cirriculums and then look for textbooks. That's my advice.

And general advice when asking for help on a specific math or physics problem:

1. Give the whole problem statement exactly as it appears in the book (including any diagrams or tables etc. if that's part of the question).
2. Show your entire attempt at a solution and explain briefly why you thought each step was correct.

Math is actually very fun (but here‚Äôs my problem),"Part of the difficulty is that the historical, chronological, *story* of the development of mathematics, is quite different from the pedagogy of *learning* mathematics, and it's not that easy to marry the two approaches in a way which doesn't fail at both goals. Many times in math history we've had someone first invent the incredibly ugly, byzantine, wildly convoluted version of a groundbreaking math idea, and then someone came along a bit later (or the same person came back to their own work) and restated it in a far more elegant way, with better notation and a conceptual framework which is more powerful, less arbitrary, easier to follow. And telling the story in this order makes for a better story, but if you're a math student trying to master the concept, it may be a lot more useful to go the other way around.

And there's the issue of accessibility. Math education tends to build upon its own foundations; chapter 2 builds on chapter 1's concepts and so on, so if you skip ahead you're liable to be pretty lost; but popularizers and storytellers about the human history of math, are generally aiming to reach a wider range of ability levels. Someone trying to tell the story of Henri Poincar√©'s life to a general audience, can't afford to tell the reader ""You must already be deeply familiar with the works of Hamilton, Riemann and Minkowsky in order to understand this story."" Their target audience would be a tiny sliver of humanity.

So, the books which get deep into the actual mathematical abstractions tend to be pretty light on human storytelling, and the books which tell the stories of mathematicians and math history, tend to gloss over all the technicalities.

One beloved classic comes to mind though: *Godel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid* by Douglas Hofstadter. It touches on a variety of topics from foundational number theory, computing science and computability theory, Boolean logic, set theory and so on, and weaves them together with ideas from philosophy, psychology, art and music, in a very playful and engaging way. It doesn't engage super deeply with the stories of the great mathematicians, and doesn't concern itself too much with historical accuracy, but it *is* written with a great abundance of storytelling *style*. And it also (IMHO) pays a very nice homage to the maths-and-fantasy writing of Lewis Carroll.","part of the difficulty is that the historical, chronological, *story* of the development of mathematics, is quite different from the pedagogy of *learning* mathematics, and it's not that easy to marry the two approaches in a way which doesn't fail at both goals. many times in math history we've had someone first invent the incredibly ugly, byzantine, wildly convoluted version of a groundbreaking math idea, and then someone came along a bit later (or the same person came back to their own work) and restated it in a far more elegant way, with better notation and a conceptual framework which is more powerful, less arbitrary, easier to follow. and telling the story in this order makes for a better story, but if you're a math student trying to master the concept, it may be a lot more useful to go the other way around.

(b) ask questions. for example, ""n(n+1)/2,"" you've probably used this formula. but try to understand _why_ it works. first, try to prove it for yourself. and if you come across an obstacle you can't pass, then watch a video on it.

(c) google the prerequisites for <insert topic> and study those. let's take calculus. you need to proficient at  functions, composite functions, logarithmic functions; understand limits, trigonometry and etc.

CAN math explain why time passes faster,"what do you mean by ‚Äúpasses faster‚Äù? 

If you mean in special/general relativity, then yeah math describes/explains it. Special relativity mostly just uses algebra, so you could totally look at that, but general relativity needs topics from topology and some other higher level maths that might be beyond your scope. 

Or do you mean how time seems to pass subjectively at different speeds for different people or at different times? Afaik thats really a psychology problem and not something you can apply math to

I can‚Äôt understand math,"Saying that you don't understand isn't very helpful. You need to tell us what your specific problems are and what you don't understand. It would help us give way better advice that could directly help your specific situation.

Part of math is following instructions and having patience.

Stop trying to understand math. What you need to do is justvfollow the instructions. Write each step down as you go. Slowly and patiently. Step-by-step.

Here's something English and math share. You don't need to understand how to write a sentence to write a sentence and you don't need to know what fractions are to do fractions. I did multiplication for years without knowing that 7 √ó 3 is literally just 7 √ó 7 √ó 7 or 3 √ó 3 √ó 3 √ó 3 √ó 3 √ó 3 √ó 3. I couldn't really hear or see when I was a kid. I just knew to memorize my multiplication tables. I now work with a bunch of engineers. For example, I asked an engineer recently how he understood the math to pass his math classes. He said he didn't understand the math. He just did it. Think to yourself... do you need to know the word ""the"" or ""a"" are articles of a sentence or what exactly a verb actually is? Plenty of people know how to read and write and speak English without knowing what a verb is or what an article is. Math and English are very abstract subjects. It's not like history class where you learn hard-facts and dates. If you read enough and speak enough English, eventually you'll learn enough intuition to just speak and write it. If you do enough math problems you'll learn enough intuition to solve math problem.

That's the secret. The more you do math, the more you learn intuition on how math works without defining every little thing.

Your teachers need to show you step-by-step what they are doing. And then you just need to copy it. And just use those steps by yourself. You need to take your time and be patient while doing the problems.


But I will leave you with one thing to help you ""understand"" math. Math is about proportionality. You get math through observation. For example, watch a car go down the road. This car is speeding down from Street A to Street B. The speed is a variable. Going from Street A to Street B can be summarized as distance. And notice that it takes a certain amount of seconds or minutes for the car to get from Street A to Street B. This can be summarized as time. That's how you get the speed, distance, and time formula. Math is about finding relationships and describing those relationships. Pure math doesn't show these descriptions... pure math spits out numbers and the theory on how to get outcomes. Pure math is a demonstration of how you can manipulate variables and numbers if that the math were to actually describe a relationship. There's nothing to truly understand beyond that point. It's just doing the math step-by-step and taking your time. If you have one variable on one side of the equation then you can move that variable to the other side of the equation. Sometimes the best idea is to NOT use numbers and instead use the variables/words in the equations and see where and how you can move those variables and words in the equation. 

Stop trying to understand. Do the steps. If you encounter a word problem, reword the word problem to a way you can understand. Like f(x) simply means ""Do function and plug in the x variable into the equation."" F(x) can sometimes also be described as the total outcome of the function. Try to find ways to describe something in your words. And use that every time you see that problem.","saying that you don't understand isn't very helpful. you need to tell us what your specific problems are and what you don't understand. it would help us give way better advice that could directly help your specific situation.

[Megathread] Post your favorite (or your own) resources/channels/what have you.,"Starting with the obvious ones:

1. Khan Academy
2. Wolfram Alpha
3. 3Blue1Brown

The less obvious to the mainstream, but perhaps obvious to normal self learners:

1. [Brilliant.org](https://Brilliant.org)
2. Crash Course Algebra

The not very well known outside of certain circles ones:

1. FreeCodeCamp (If you look through they have a lot of math courses. Most are 12-14 long video's that deep dive one thing. 

My personal favorite learning flow:

1. Use Khan Academy as the main source of knowledge. This is the one you go from Algebra --> Calculus on and the one that you focus on complete mastery. 
2. Use [Brilliant.org](https://Brilliant.org) as your first step in any new terrain and also your way of cultivating a better way of thinking about math. 
   1. How to use Khan and Brilliant together? I personally suggest looking at khan first if you're new to math-- but instead of actually solving problems or watching video's just look at what topics there are and see what you're going to be doing next. For example, you might peruse khan academy and decide to start on Algebra 1. After that, switch over to [brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org) and do two things: 
      1. Go through the 'core' mathematical thinking courses. I'm talking the logic, problem solving, mathematical fundamentals, algebra fundamentals, geometry fundamentals, etc. 
      2. Look at which Brilliant course corresponds to the next piece you're going to do on Khan Academy. If that's algebra I, then you should observe that there is also an algebra 1 course on brilliant. Open that course up on brilliant, and check the pre-requisites. In this case it states that you should already have algebra fundamentals, so if you did those earlier-- you should be good to jump in. However, if you chose to start on Algebra 2 or Geometry on Khan Academy, you might open up some different pre-requisites and notice you haven't done them. At this point it's up to you if you want to do them on [Brilliant.org](https://Brilliant.org) if you've already learned those basic concepts in school or if you'd rather still do them. For me, I suggest doing them anyways. I took Algebra 1, Geometry and Algebra 2 in high school, but instead of going right to Trigonometry or Pre-Calculus I started with pre-algebra on brilliant and I do not regret it. There were some things I knew, yes, but I went through them quickly since unlike Khan Academy brilliant doesn't require 'mastery' but rather lets you self pace. So just solving the problems doesn't take very long if you truly know it-- then when you come across something you missed, forgot or simply never learned-- you'll have a chance to fill in the gaps. Additionally, [brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org) often teaches you things that your school didn't teach you (perhaps because its' too difficult for children, but technically \*should\* fit in with that course), so it's often worth at least skimming through courses you think you already know the content of. 
3. Use Wolfram Alpha only when you have tried to solve a problem multiple times, but are unable to do so-- or if you got marked wrong and didn't find the help on khan/brilliant very helpful and want a second look at the step by step process. Sometimes a different perspective helps a lot. 
4. 3Blue1Brown
   1. For this channel, I suggest just watching whatever happens to interest you. Once you get through the advanced maths though it's probably good to go through his calculus, linear algebra and differential equations series because he's more likely than not going to give you a new/fresh perspective on something. 
5. Crash Course Algebra
   1. This one isn't really necessary, but I did watch through the series on x2 speed before starting my [brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org/khan) / khan academy journey and I don't regret it. It was a good refresher and got me thinking about math in simple easy way. (I could watch it while half asleep in the morning, or late at night when I was getting tired, or I could watch it before work, etc. It doesn't require a lot of time per episode so it's not a bad thing to just casually go through. I even watched it while eating lunch a few times.)
6. Free Code Camp
   1. For this one, i'd say it's best if you already have a pretty strong idea of your math level, or if you want to review something you learned many years ago but don't want to spend a lot of time doing it. A normal Khan Academy course could take a pretty long amount of time, but if you have a free weekend you can plow through the entirety of a course using the Free Code Camp Youtube Math Video's.","starting with the obvious ones:

how can reddit help me become a better teacher?,"I am neither a mathematician nor a teacher, so I am definitely not qualified to answer this, but I‚Äôm going to anyways.

I think helping others on reddit can help with teaching because people ask all sorts of questions from varying levels of understanding. As someone who in the process of teaching myself undergrad math, I ask a lot of questions on the math side of reddit. I get a lot of answers from people who have a more formal approach to math than I do, and a lot of these answers can be really intimidating. 

When I‚Äôm confused, I usually find that my confusion comes from a misunderstanding of prerequisite material, or a false assumption about what we are trying to achieve. I think most confusion comes from some combination of these two things, and that that combination will be different for each person. The challenge with teaching imo is recognizing these misunderstandings and assumptions while coming from a place of understanding yourself.

With reddit, I think you can get good practice recognizing the unique ways people get confused, and correcting those misunderstandings in a way that isn‚Äôt confusing itself. When I‚Äôm asking a question about a topic, the last thing I want is for someone to re-explain the topic to me using formal logic. I literally just watched a lecture and read the textbook. What I need is for someone to reframe the topic in a way that uniquely makes sense to me.

I‚Äôve learned through experience that this gets me the best chance of really ‚Äúgetting it‚Äù. Not only am I getting more replies from unique users, but by slowly refining my question, people are prompted to answer differently. Eventually, someone gives an answer that is just right to help me reframe the concept and understand the topic. 

I think part of the problem with reddit however is that it is self selecting. People who ask questions on a particular sub are likely inquisitive and willing to seek help simply because they chose to go on the math reddit.

Starting University Math After 14 Years ‚Äî Looking for Advice,"Read the appropriate sections of the text before each lecture.

I find math really hard,"I think what would help to take a moment to go back and review basics, and maybe take the opportunity to rebuild your foundation. For example, gaining a good feeling of basic mathematics, improving your numeracy skills so you‚Äôre confident with numbers. From that point, you‚Äôre understanding of all the numbers will help in your understanding of other aspects of maths, building into Algebra, shapes and statistics.

How to use math books?,"Math books are tricky, so you aren't wrong to ask this.  Here's what I do:

1) Read a section canonically as it is written, until I get to the exercises.

2) Do the exercises.  See if I get the ideas.  If I don't, go back and look for a clear explanation of what went wrong.

3) Every now and then, go back through the chapters and ask if I clearly understand what it is about, headline by headline.  Make sure it all looks recognizable.

In my experience, math books are pretty good at explaining somewhere which sections are core knowledge and which aren't.  It helps to have a study interest in mind so you have a clue which parts of what you're studying are most directly applicable to the thing that interests you.  You should skip sections if they are marked as optional AND you don't feel an urge to look into them - you can save those for later and revisit if you need to.

Math books are incredibly dense.  It's normal to read a 10-page span like its 100 pages long in pursuit of building intuition.","math books are tricky, so you aren't wrong to ask this.  here's what i do:

How do you solve problems?,"This is a huge question and there's no good way to give a full answer. I imagine different professionals will have very different experiences and methods too... In any case, to respond to the final ""what do you do?"": you struggle!

Simply put, if you can't apply the topic, then you don't understand the topic (or at least the prerequisites). Understanding requires *knowledge*. I don't care if you can do homework problems or give an intuitive explanation. For example, can you tell me, right now with perfect wording:

* what a function is
* why you do the same thing to both sides of an equation
* the three equation types you can solve?

I cannot solve this problem -> why can't I solve it? -> do I understand what the problem is asking me?

"I‚Äôm a teenager, but was never given a proper education. How do I teach myself?","Bit of context from my experience, learning is a journey and not a race. In the military they often drill the mindset of being an active learner, not that many of the service members do much to enforce that ideology, but it hits the nail right on the head that learning and chasing after curiosity needs to be habitual. 

Don‚Äôt get motivated for a couple days, do some Khan Academy, maybe fill out some test forms, watch some YouTube, and then burn out to not continue learning for the next 2-6 months only to repeat this process again in that time. You‚Äôll have accomplished nothing because by the time you implement that knowledge you‚Äôll have forgotten most of it. 

Build up your fundamentals, even if they are boring. Basic multiplication, addition, subtraction. I‚Äôm 30 and I still enjoy counting in my everyday life for things like adding up costs, comparing two things as a ratio, turning things into fractions or percentages, counting calories, etc. I may not be a mathematician, but I feel very confident in my analysis skills and ability to quickly come to a fairly close prediction for basic math related things like multiplying large numbers. Remember that for most people math is a tool using your rationality to gain a better understanding of the world around you. It lets you break down things you may not be cognizant of and come to better realizations due to being able to reason and logic through it.

I agree on taking courses, but also, ask yourself interesting questions and see how far you can reason through them. For instance I loved questions like ‚ÄúHow far do I travel in a minute going X miles vs Y miles?‚Äù growing up because they made me have to move the different values around in my head until things made sense to me. People can explain concepts and ideas to you all day long and you may be able to regurgitate them back to others to seem smarter or more skilled, but being able to objectively look at something, ask yourself some questions, and reason through them to find that answer out at least partially for yourself will take you much further than strictly doing some freebie course and calling it good.

I‚Äôm an engineering major so I am versed in many forms of math above basic arithmetic of course, but I only got good at that later math because I had such developed fundamentals. If you enjoy math and want to learn more then as long as you build good habits you‚Äôll naturally learn more and more through your own interests and efforts.","bit of context from my experience, learning is a journey and not a race. in the military they often drill the mindset of being an active learner, not that many of the service members do much to enforce that ideology, but it hits the nail right on the head that learning and chasing after curiosity needs to be habitual.

The best way to learn math is to *understand* why it's true - which you can do by exploring the ideas. Play around with things, try and see what happens with different numbers. What happens if you do things a technically correct but different way - do you get the same results? If there are conditions on when something happens, what happens when you break those conditions?

How can I understand the logic of arithmetic better (seriously)?,"You might be interested in the book ""Where Mathematics Comes From"" by Lakoff and Nu√±ez.¬† It talks a lot about the biology of a sense of numbers, and then also looks into the cultural aspects of how mathematics emerged.

One of the things it talks about that I found interesting is ""subitizing,"" a phenomenon in which humans can instantly count small numbers of objects. So, if we're looking at three things, we don't need to count them to know there are three. By five objects it becomes conditional--if they're in, or close to fitting, certain configurations, we can know there are five without counting, but in order arrangements we'll either need to count, or to subitize two subgroups and add.


I know it's not exactly the same thing you're asking, but I think you'll find it relevant.

College math is starting to feel impossible,"Some words of encouragement: 

I'm terrible at math and trying to get better as an adult. I accepted that I'm ""not a math person"" years ago, but I related this sentiment to my wife, whose undergrad is in mathematics and she rejected the idea outright. 

She basically said that, yes, math can be hard, and it was hard for her. Getting that math degree required lots of studying, and struggling, and going to office hours whenever she could and putting in tons of effort. She often felt like others were just naturally gifted and she was dragging behind everyone. But she just put in the work and kept going. 

So the encouragement is basically that, yes, it's hard, but that doesn't mean you are wrong for pursuing it! The stoics would tell you that the obstacle IS the way. So keep at it, and don't worry about others.

 Remember: your professors are being paid to help you learn math. Make sure they're doing their job, even if you have lots of questions. Others in the room probably have the same one, but are embarrassed about asking. Don't assume because your professor has a degree and knows the subject they are teaching it well. If it's confusing, ask questions! I'm now speaking as a teacher (middle and high school) and I let all of my students know education is a two way street. My job is to do my best to transmit information, and their job is to do their best to receive it. But that means it's their responsibility to let me know if things don't make sense. Just because I'm sending information doesn't mean it's a perfect lesson, and if they don't get it, I haven't done my job! But if they don't let me know they don't get it, I'm not going to try a different approach!

So, work hard, ask questions, and embrace the challenge! Good luck!","some words of encouragement:

Linear Algebra...,"There are 2 or 3 places in a mathematics education that I call ""breaks"" - places where you are floating along, everything seems to be going well, you understand everything nicely, and then suddenly they hit you over the head with a bunch of abstractions that just don't seem to make sense at all.

Calculus is one - probably more of a minor one.  Concepts like differentiation, integration, and limits are fundamentally different that anything you likely encountered before.

Now you have hit a second one: The abstraction of linear algebra.  Instead of just ""here are some rules for how to multiply matrices and calculate determinants"" it is suddenly ""Here is a whole abstract mathematical system based on these axioms"".

This is so different from how you (and most people) are used to thinking about things that it is a real difficult point for many people.

The third major ""break"" that hits math majors is when you have your first class that revolves around proofs rather than a bunch of problems you need to solve.

Others have given good advice about how to get your head around the definitions, axioms, and abstractions - what a vector space is, and all that. But sometimes it is helpful just to understand that *this really is a difficult spot, many others struggle with it for the same reasons, it is a big conceptual leap and a major increase in the level of abstraction, and it is very much OK if it takes you a while to get your head around all the concepts*.

Also, I will say that there are two major benefits if you *can* get your head around them:

 \- The whole idea of vectors, vector spaces, and associated concepts are very, very, VERY practically useful in many fields

 \- Beyond that, learning how to deal with abstractions of this type is very powerful in itself.  The whole of modern mathematics is built on this type of foundation.  So if you can 'crack the code' - even at just a very basic level - it opens up a lot of potential understanding in mathematics that is not otherwise available.

So keep at it - you may not see the reason or purpose behind it now, but if you keep at it, you will!","there are 2 or 3 places in a mathematics education that i call ""breaks"" - places where you are floating along, everything seems to be going well, you understand everything nicely, and then suddenly they hit you over the head with a bunch of abstractions that just don't seem to make sense at all.

I can‚Äôt understand math,"It is very common to have a strength in either English or Math but not both.  I‚Äôve found that in HS people who are good at language but not math have difficulty with the precision of math.  In language, you can shift around and make sense of something from a different angle or if you have a different take or a different stream of logic it can still work out.

Struggling to Learn Math with AI: Looking for Advice,"I would recommend against AI-based learning with the exception of Math Academy, which is excellent for learning procedural math (becoming a 'user of math') up to the low-undergrad level.

How did you even learn math in uni?,"Math is one of the more unforgiving majors. In other majors (even CS), if you learn topics out of order, you'll still accumulate the same general knowledge. In math there is a much stricter progression. If you don't get A, then you won't get B.

So what you have to do is:

1. Take a deep breath, don't berate yourself. Realize that the math class is designed for an abstract student, and that is not necessarily where your level is going to be when you start the class.
2. Use the challenging parts of a class as a way to highlight your knowledge gaps. Then backfill that knowledge on your own using other resources. The first 3 weeks of math classes can be brutal because you might discover you have a lot of gaps. That's normal!
3. Focus on precision, rigor, and motivation. Know your definitions. Know the ""why do people care"" part too. Don't just read solutions; ask yourself how you can come up with a solution.¬†
4. If you're stuck, rewind to the last problem that semi-makes-sense-but-not-really, and overlearn that.¬†Math is not a ""spend more time, see more results"" subject.

"new to math, and i want to ace IMO to secure a seat in highly prestigious math and statistics collages","Only six people per country get to the IMO. The competitors for these places have likely done competition maths for a while and usually also need a lot of raw talent. For all but the smallest countries, it's an unreasonable goal if you are just starting out.

That being said, taking part in maths competition can be a lot of fun if you enjoy maths. You get to meet other people who are passionate about maths, which is somewhat rare in the populace.

To prepare, you might want to look up some basic number theory (module arithmetic, prime numbers, divisibility rules, etc.), some geometry (theorems on triangles circles, erc), some combinatorics (permutations, binomial coefficients) and some general things (how to write a proof).
With that, you should try to solve some past problems of the competitions you plan to attend. Start with the earliest rounds and then slowly increase difficulty (even the easiest problems from the international round can be outrageously hard without enough experience)

So definitely do take part in maths competitions, but go in with reasonable expectations (i.e., not qualifying for the second round is somewhat likely).

Bottom-top approach in math textbooks,"> mathematicians seem to first develop some basic definitions,state some axioms and other immediate lemmas/theorems are then built on them,and math textbooks use a similar format, but honestly this kind of a definitions-propositions-lemmas/theorem-corollary formal troubles me a little as a physics student when I sit down to read math textbooks and the reason is pretty simple...it looks highly unmotivated at first. 

This is a reasonable thing to say based on how mathematicians write books and talk about our subject.  But this is not psychologically or historically how mathematics is actually developed.

Math is usually developed from a high-level idea or question, and lower-level tools and objects are constructed to answer the question.  This is mostly the same as in physics.  

However, after the discovery has been made, mathematicians organize the new information into textbooks.  Textbooks are usually praised for their ""efficiency"", especially among other mathematicians who already understand the subject.  Books are most efficient when they cut out the discovery process and get straight to the pure logical flow from definition to proof.

I think this makes textbooks very bad for students learning the subject, but it makes them great as reference texts.  Since textbooks are mostly reference texts and not pedagogical texts, then the pedagogy is usually filled in by the professor.  Obviously the quality of that depends on the professor.  

In fact, I think the same thing happens -- maybe to a slightly lesser degree -- in physics.

How can I break out of overly procedural thinking,"The key for me is understanding what you are doing. Let's take a simple example. Let's say you have been taught that:

(area of rectangle) = (length) √ó (width)

You have done hundreds of calculations where you are given a length and a width and find the area. Then, without warning, you are given a problem where you are given the area of the rectangle and one of the sides. 

Now, for pretty much everyone reading this, this is trivial. You either know algebra well enough to rearrange the equation or you know rectangles well enough to be understand how this all works and the equation you are given is just a reflection of the properties of a rectangle. 

I'd recommend trying this approach. When you have an equation or algorithm try to understand how it works and why it is the way it is. 

Now, unless you are really clever (more so than me) there will always be equations that (at least at this point in your journey) you find yourself unable to understand in this way.

nowadays for me more often this means trying to write proofs, typically using a proof assistant or programming language‚Äîif my explanation is simple enough that even a computer can understand it, then i *probably* understand it well enough to move forward.",0.3434932,0

How can I get better at algebra?,"You absolutely should focus on a specific operation. It's not a huge complicated web of interlocking pieces that are somehow larger than the sum of their parts. Algebra is built off a list of 11 rules, and you have to be able to read a bit of notation. 

People mostly struggle because they never got the foundations. Once you master the basics, the rest is pretty much automatic, because you're just following rules. But you can't follow the rules if you don't read them. Common issues are not knowing what a function really is (it's not complicated), thinking parentheses cause multiplication (they don't do anything), and reading subtraction wrong (subtraction isn't real). 

Whatever your issues are, you can only fix one at a time. They don't work together and they don't have to be untangled. And the list is shorter than you think. 

Basically this is to agree with the others: pick one thing that is an issue and post a question about it. Make sure it's totally solid to the foundations. Then repeat. It won't actually take that long. Most people try to learn math by aping different problem types. You can't learn math that way (literally, it's impossible). But the list of rules is pretty short. 

Otoh, if you have trouble just getting started, there's always Khan Academy. It won't fix the above, and it gets some things wrong (and actively does the thing I just said not to do), BUT it helps you dip your toes.","you absolutely should focus on a specific operation. it's not a huge complicated web of interlocking pieces that are somehow larger than the sum of their parts. algebra is built off a list of 11 rules, and you have to be able to read a bit of notation.

How to start studying Putnam?,"I think there are really two important keys: *practice* and *society*.

For practice: The Putnam has almost complete archives of past exams. Pick a problem from the last ten years (don't go back much further than two decades, because styles in problem-setting change slowly, and you want exams that resemble modern ones). Sit down and try to solve it. At first, don't put yourself under any time pressure. Take as long as you need to solve the problem you've picked. Now, some people disagree with me about this, but I think that you do 99% of your actual learning in the very few minutes right around the time that you find the solution *for yourself* and write it down. The hours of work leading up to that magic moment might teach you stamina, but not any actual mathematics. Now here's the crucial point: in comparison, having somebody *tell* you the solution will teach you almost nothing. First of all, it's not nearly as intense an experience; second, you aren't likely to really engage with a provided answer; and third, the actual answer is just a fraction of what you need. I might show you the answer, and you could look at it and agree that it's correct, but still not have the faintest idea how I found it.

So I advise people *not to look up answers at all*. If you work on a problem for two weeks (say, an hour a night) and are making no headway at all, then *still* don't look at the answer. Just set the problem aside and start working on another one. Every once in a while, go back through your personal archive of unsolved problems to see if you have any fresh ideas. As your skills improve, you'll find that problems that once stumped you now fall within your range.

Now, for society: find other people with about your age and background who are also interesting in training up for the Putnam. Form a club. Meet once a week. Have some pizza and just geek out about what you've been studying and whether you've learned anything cool. Having others around you who are also interested is a strong incentive and catalyst for making progress.

Much less important, but it still could help: side reading. I recommend that you start getting into the recreational mathematics literature. Martin Gardner wrote more than a dozen collections of columns he wrote for his Scientific American column in the 1950's, 1960's, and 1970's. Any library of decent size will have one or two -- just look up Martin Gardner in the catalog. Another great book is Albert Beiler's *Recreations in the Theory of Numbers: The Queen of Mathematics Entertains*. Yet another is by John Conway and Richard Guy, called *The Book of Numbers*. Read these for pleasure in between practice sessions. It all helps you get in the habit of thinking mathematically.

What should I take after Calc III,"You have calc 3, linear algebra, and differential equations in your high school? Kudos to your school district, that's impressive. People vary on which one they recommend taking first, but I always recommend taking linear algebra before differential equations. Differential equations uses a lot of techniques from linear algebra that click a lot better imo when you already know linear algebra. That said, you don't really use calculus in a linear algebra course, but you obviously use it a lot in differential equations.

As for what they are and how difficult they are:

* **Linear Algebra:** remember how you learned how to solve ""systems of linear equations"" in elementary school, like ""x+y = 3, x-y = 5, solve for x and y""? It basically starts out with that. You learn how to describe those kinds of situations with matrices and vectors, and then you get into a bunch of complicated vector space stuff. It can be hard for people because it's typically taught in a proof-based way where you need to understand how to prove stuff is true, though idk if that's the case in a high school course. This is definitely one of *the* most important classes anyone learns for any math-based field.
* **Differential Equations:** Instead of solving systems of *linear* equations, you solve systems of *differential* equations, like ""if f(0) = 3 and f(x) = 2f'(x), what's f(x)?"" A lot of those same ideas from linear algebra can be applied here to solve these similar situations. The course isn't usually *conceptually* difficult, like linear algebra can be, but it is *a lot* of computation. This will probably be the most computationally-heavy courses you ever take.
* **Stats:** I believe AP stats doesn't get into explaining complicated stats, like describing normal distribution as an integral and such. It covers a lot of stats formulas and probability to find the odds of different events happening based on some observations of data. I don't believe they really explain the formulas much in AP stats since they can be difficult to prove, though I could be wrong about that since I never took it in high school.
* **Calc 3:** Most people find this class much easier than calc 2. It's very similar to calc 2 in the sense that all the integrals are solved the same ways, it's just *more* of them, basically. That said, calc 3 makes the jump from 2 dimensions to n dimensions, and *that* can be difficult for some students to grasp. It also leads to a lot of annoying problems that you don't run into with 2 dimensions. In terms of computation though, it's the same level as calc 2, just easier now that you know calc 2.","you have calc 3, linear algebra, and differential equations in your high school? kudos to your school district, that's impressive. people vary on which one they recommend taking first, but i always recommend taking linear algebra before differential equations. differential equations uses a lot of techniques from linear algebra that click a lot better imo when you already know linear algebra. that said, you don't really use calculus in a linear algebra course, but you obviously use it a lot in differential equations.

Big math question,"You are falling into one of the most common traps people fall into early in their mathematica journey, physicallization. You are think of mathematical operations as if they were physical things that you did to objects, instead of things you to do *numbers* (or other mathematical entities) that you can use to *describe* physical objects. Multiplication is not a physical process. 

You can't multiply pencils. Or add pencils. Or divide pencils. Any more than you can spell a fish or conjugate a raccoon. We spell and conjugate *words* and use words to *describe* the world. We do arithmetic with *numbers* and then use numbers to *describe* the world.

If I have one pencil in a box, and another two pencils in a different box, I can use the expression 1 + 2 = 3 to describe how many pencils I have now. But I am not adding pencils, I am adding numbers.

If I have three box of two pencils, I can use the expression 3 x 2 = 2 to describe how many total pencils I have. But I didn't multiply pencils or boxes. I multiplied numbers 

'What is a pencil multiplied by itself' makes as much sense as 'what color is justice' or 'how much does hungry weigh'. It's what we would call a 'category error'. 

This is hard for folks, because it requires 'abstraction', the ability to think without tying yourself to a physical picture. This is a very hard skill to learn.","you are falling into one of the most common traps people fall into early in their mathematica journey, physicallization. you are think of mathematical operations as if they were physical things that you did to objects, instead of things you to do *numbers* (or other mathematical entities) that you can use to *describe* physical objects. multiplication is not a physical process.

Galois Theory Humbled Me,"The way Galois theory is frequently taught is *awful*.  You're told this has to do with insolubility of the quintic, trisection of the angle, etc.  Then you're taught a bunch of stuff about fields that doesn't appear to have anything to do with any of this.  You're shown theorems without being given any idea why someone would want to consider these questions or what the results even mean.  And then if you slog through all that, at the end they show you some argument strung together from some of these results and it's just impossible to follow because you never grokked any of the stuff you were supposedly learning.

If people would just explain this stuff better I think it would lose a lot of its mystique and at the same time be something a lot more people were able to appreciate.","the way galois theory is frequently taught is *awful*.  you're told this has to do with insolubility of the quintic, trisection of the angle, etc.  then you're taught a bunch of stuff about fields that doesn't appear to have anything to do with any of this.  you're shown theorems without being given any idea why someone would want to consider these questions or what the results even mean.  and then if you slog through all that, at the end they show you some argument strung together from some of these results and it's just impossible to follow because you never grokked any of the stuff you were supposedly learning.

it gives the birds-eye view of the standard linear algebra course focusing on the difficult aspects of the course with detailed explanatioins and with very rigorous proofs.

i will let you be the judge on that. in addition, i have a playlist with hard integrals and challenging problems in analysis:

I can't really grasp matrices (apologies if this is an overdone topic),"A lot of great explanations, but I want to give some more insight into use cases. 

Linear algebra is used to work with 3 (or more) dimensional space. We have found a lot of ways to model things this way, for example each column could be a datapoint and suddenly you're halfway to machine learning. In calculus of multiple variables linear algebra is used as the ground you stand on, putting variables into matrices. This leads into a multitude of applications in physics (like all of physics). Linear algebra also pops up in proofs in unrelated areas every now and again such as graph theory or combinatorics.

A lot of our computers are optimized for fast work on matrices, such as GPU's, it has pretty much become our standard way of dealing with math on large amounts of data, which is something some programmers will need to do so if you are interested in simulations, computer graphics, machine learning, high performance computing, etc then linear algebra is the most important math course you'll take.","a lot of great explanations, but i want to give some more insight into use cases.

maths is beautiful at this level because either you are right or you are wrong. so, once you know how to get the right answer, you will be able to do well in your exams and then start focusing on the maths you actually want to do (if any).",0.32779798,0

Where should I start with self studying math?,"Start with a solid review of basic algebra. Make sure you really understand topics like solving equations, working with expressions, and basic functions. Once you are comfortable, move on to topics in geometry and then more advanced topics such as sequences and series. Using a resource like Khan Academy is a good idea because it offers clear lessons and plenty of practice exercises. Khan Academy is widely used in schools and by self-study for its step-by-step approach 



It is important to work regularly on problems and review topics frequently. If you struggle with retention, try to explain what you learned in your own words or teach it to someone else. This practice is supported by research in learning strategies and has helped many students improve their understanding. 

Finally, be patient.

Linear Algebra would be typically taught to college students entering Math, Physics or engineering usually in their freshman year. This would be for 18 year olds who already finished introductory calculus. There is almost no way to go from basic Algebra to Linear Algebra in one step.

"With trig, how much should it feel like 'magic'?","For the identities the trick to 'demagic' them is to actually work through proving them.  I found the visual, geometric proofs were the best for me.  If they feel like total 'magic' then you have an issue eventually because you will forget them, be unable to apply them creatively, or to extend them when needed.

So try proving the law of sines, law of cosines, angle addition identities, sin\^2 + cos\^2 = 1, so go from there.  It's a mix of algebra and geometry.  Once you go through it you'll feel much more confident in using them.

Proving trig identities especially on your own will actually be a lot closer to 'real math' than the plug and chug procedural work you'll generally be asked to do in high school and early undergrad.

math is shitt,"First off. Shit is spelled with a single t.  Second, you will want to discover the comma and other connectives, or those good marks you speak of, are likely going to disappear rather quickly.

Next, if you want to be good at trigonometry, I'd suggest practicing. If you are not taking a trigonometry-specific course, you will want to do so. These come in two flavors, very broadly speaking, pre-calculus will cover trigonometry in a useful way in terms of learning how to manipulate the objects of interest and prepare you to use Calculus in regards to them. 

There are also Trigonometry and Geometry courses. These will intuit the geometric beauty of trigonometry, and usually focus more on the planar geometric aspects. 

For your own time, you need to figure out the minimal number of rules that you need to memorize to derive any of the trig identities. This is going to do two things for you.

Good textbooks for combinatorics and number theory for self study.,"Although there is some overlap between them, combinatorics and number theory are usually treated as separate subjects. There is usually a good introductory unit on combinatorics in any ""discrete mathematics"" textbook, of which there are now many, but I don't have a specific recommendation. Perhaps another commenter will have one. Once you have gotten started in combinatorics, though, I strongly recommend Herbert Wilf's quirky book *generatingfunctionology* (all one word, lower case), which is usually available online for free with the author's blessing.

For number theory there is an embarrassment of riches, with many good available textbooks. I'll keep to authorized free online stuff. Karl-Dieter Crisman wrote and maintains *Number Theory: In Context and Interactive*. It's unique feature is that it's integrated with the number-theory and computer algebra system called SageMath, so you can try experiments right out of the book. Sage is widely used in the field and is worth learning. You can find a copy easily by searching for the author and title.

Another free site is Bruce Ikenaga's, at [https://sites.millersville.edu/bikenaga/number-theory/number-theory-notes.html](https://sites.millersville.edu/bikenaga/number-theory/number-theory-notes.html), which is more of a set of lecture notes. It doesn't have too many good exercises, and is probably aimed at a more mathematically mature student, but the explanations are very good.

All the sources I've mentioned assume that you are comfortable with the definition/theorem/proof style of mathematical exposition. If you're *not* then you should probably remedy that problem separately, first. *All* of higher mathematics depends on your familiarity with these concepts. If you're not sure, go through a couple of sections of Crisman and see if you feel like you are in over your head. If you can get through the first set of exercises with no real trouble (section 1.4), you're fine and can keep going. But if not, you should probably go through an introduction to mathematical proof like Daniel Velleman's *How to Prove It*.","although there is some overlap between them, combinatorics and number theory are usually treated as separate subjects. there is usually a good introductory unit on combinatorics in any ""discrete mathematics"" textbook, of which there are now many, but i don't have a specific recommendation. perhaps another commenter will have one. once you have gotten started in combinatorics, though, i strongly recommend herbert wilf's quirky book *generatingfunctionology* (all one word, lower case), which is usually available online for free with the author's blessing.

Not understanding field extensions,">Like, if you need all these other numbers, why not just start with complex field to begin with?

Here's an analogy. You probably know the *fundamental theorem of arithmetic*: any positive integer can be written as a product of prime numbers, and this product is **unique**. Example: 75 = 3√ó5√ó5, and you can swap around the 3 and the 5s if you want, but other than that, there is **no** other way of writing 75 as a product of primes.

This is really useful, because it makes the concept of ""divisibility"" meaningful! If you want to find positive integer solutions to an equation like x(x+2)(x+6) = 9975, then you can argue e.g. ""the right-hand side isn't divisible by 2, **and therefore** the left-hand side isn't divisible by 2, and so x, x+2 and x+6 must be odd"". Or ""the right-hand side is divisible by 5, **and therefore** the left-hand side is divisible by 5, and so either x or x+2 or x+6 is divisible by 5"". This helps you narrow down your possibilities.

However, it crucially relies on our choice of positive integers. If you expand it to negative integers, then you could have written 75 = 3√ó5√ó5√ó-1√ó-1. If you expand it to rationals, you could have written 75 = 3√ó5√ó5√ó2√ó(1/2). If you expand it to real numbers, 75 = 3√ó5√ó5√óœÄ√ó(1/œÄ)... and so on. Is 9975 divisible by 2 **in the real numbers**? Sure, but everything is divisible by (basically) everything in the real numbers, so you don't learn anything any more.

Here's a reason that's a bit more Galois-theory-specific:

>what if we just extend the field by adding the root to it? Great, now we have Q(<root 1>). And we can keep going! Q(<root1>,<root2>), etc. yay!

Galois theory isn't quite the study of **fields** \- it's the study of **field extensions**. So, for example, you're not just studying Q(i), you're studying the process of going **from** Q **to** Q(i) - more specifically, if you nail down Q in place (so nothing in Q can move), how much freedom does the rest of Q(i) have to move around (e.g. complex conjugation will keep Q nailed down in place but will send i to -i)? This means a few things:

* The smaller the extension is, the easier it is to understand the process. Going from Q to C means adding in a huge amount of extra numbers, which means it's harder for you to say anything concrete about it.
* The more numbers you add in, the more those numbers can interact with each other, which can place extra constraints on what you can do. For example, let's suppose you go from Q to Q(‚àö2), and you then want to ""do"" something to ‚àö2. There is an operation very much like complex conjugation on this field extension: you can send ‚àö2 to -‚àö2 (or, more generally, a + b‚àö2 to a - b‚àö2), and this preserves lots of very nice properties of the field extension. But **now** suppose you extend even further, and throw in a square root of ‚àö2, which I might as well call ‚àú2. **Now** you have the extra constraint (‚àú2)¬≤ = ‚àö2, i.e. ‚àö2 is the square of a real number. But squares of real numbers can't be negative, so you're no longer able to send ‚àö2 to -‚àö2!

The take-home message is: you don't want **all** the numbers. You want as few numbers as necessary. The more numbers you have, the **less** freedom you have to explore the kind of structure **within** and the relationships **between** those numbers.",">like, if you need all these other numbers, why not just start with complex field to begin with?

I want to become a computer programmer but don't know math at all and struggle with it.,"I suggest looking at the catalog for your CCs required credits for your desired degree. 

See what math related classes are required to get an idea of what to expect. Different types of IT & Compsci degrees require different types of math course work, some harder than others. 

Be transparent about your struggles with math to your professors. My friend did this and she is in compsci and was able to get some accommodations for her troubles with math. 

About learning math‚Ä¶ figure out what your learning style is and then find resources that work for you. Do you feel comfortable with textbooks and reading? Maybe find some workbooks that are oriented for adults to work from the ground up. I know a few good ones if you are looking for recommendations, DM me, I can also send them as ebooks to you as well. Like videos? We live in a day and age with a treasure trove of free educational content. The world‚Äôs your oyster. 

Keep in mind, working with books and videos oriented for children may feel discouraging, and adults learn faster and more intuitively than children do. A lot of adults for one reason or another want or need to learn math, whether that is self driven or a required skill for their field of study. 

If you REALLY want to go into programming, your drive for that career path should enable you to have the drive to learn math.

see what math related classes are required to get an idea of what to expect. different types of it & compsci degrees require different types of math course work, some harder than others. 

be transparent about your struggles with math to your professors. my friend did this and she is in compsci and was able to get some accommodations for her troubles with math. 

about learning math‚Ä¶ figure out what your learning style is and then find resources that work for you. do you feel comfortable with textbooks and reading? maybe find some workbooks that are oriented for adults to work from the ground up. i know a few good ones if you are looking for recommendations, dm me, i can also send them as ebooks to you as well. like videos? we live in a day and age with a treasure trove of free educational content. the world‚Äôs your oyster. 

keep in mind, working with books and videos oriented for children may feel discouraging, and adults learn faster and more intuitively than children do. a lot of adults for one reason or another want or need to learn math, whether that is self driven or a required skill for their field of study. 

if you really want to go into programming, your drive for that career path should enable you to have the drive to learn math. i don‚Äôt think it is impossible or some predetermined skill to be good at math. it‚Äôs about technique, motivation and self belief. it‚Äôs just another hurdle on the path to your goal in life, but you can hop over it with diligence and practice.",0.32046458,0

Where‚Äôs a good place to start learning proofs?,"Hi. I'm a mathematical physics grad student and I'd like to speak to you from this perspective.

Math proofs are much heavier than what you'd need for typical physics. Even if you're doing purely theoretical physics, you really don't need the in-depth understanding of math that you would get from studying mathematical proofs.

All that considered, if you still want a go, let's DO IT!

So a good option for a first textbook is Discrete math and it's applications by Kenneth H. Rosen. This will introduce you to very foundational logic; the application of logic into making a mathematical proof, and then some very basic proofs in number theory and combinatorics. The one problem with this book is because it's discrete math as opposed to continuous math, you are going to miss out on a good deep dive into calculus topics.

Now this is the part where this is super overkill, but if you want to go into calculus proofs, You'll want to do Advanced calculus by Patrick M. Fitzpatrick. In this book, you'll go over very foundational properties of real numbers. You'll learn about the supremums of intervals, rigorously proving convergence of sequences. Rigorously proving continuity of a function and relating epsilon-delta definitions with converging sequences, rigorous proofs about properties of derivatives and integrals, and then approximating with series.

If you want the ""honors' version, the big book is called ""principles of mathematical analysis"" by walter Rudin. It is more or less the same content, but instead of strictly real numbers, you will be taught in the context of arbitrary topological metric spaces. There's also much more side topics like differential geometry and the fundamental theorem of algebra (yes, it's funny, the fundamental theorem of algebra is an analysis proof instead of an algebraic one). Furthermore, this will introduce you to measure theory and a more generalized kind of integral called ""Lebesgue"". In this form of integral, you can calculate things like the integral of a function that's 1 if x is irrational and 0 if it's rational.

If you're a quantum kind of person, you'd also be very interested in Algebra (and particularly group theory). Algebra by Michael Artin is a great book for undergrad algebra, and it has a good section on group theory and group representation theory which are both important for quantum field theory.

22/7 is a irrational number,"There's a lot of probably well-intended humour in this thread, which may be confusing to someone who's learning the area.

There are three key concepts that I think are relevant here (and forget about repeating vs non-repeating decimals, that's just a particular representation not anything fundamental).

Rational numbers: A number that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers. 22/7 is obviously rational. Your professor probably just misspoke.

Anything that is not rational is irrational, but there are two subtypes of irrational number, and the difference between them is important.

1. Algebraic numbers: A number that is the solution to a polynomial equation (which has rational numbers as coefficients) - e.g. sqrt(2) is irrational.

2. Transcendental numbers: Any number that is not rational or algebraic. For example pi and e are both transcendental.

Now, you might wonder - how many transcendental numbers are there? Many.

In fact, many more than the algebraic numbers. Want to know specifically what ""many more"" means in this context? Welcome to a fascinating question that can act as the gateway to some fascinating mathematics.

Galois Theory Humbled Me,"I went to grad school in algebraic geometry, with the intention of doing a PhD and going into academia. I didn't exactly hit the wall your describing - I continued to do well in classes and produced a bit of decent research - but it stopped being fun for me. 

At some point I felt like I was just wading through an endless sea of dense notation and abstraction, with very little intuition left about the subjects I was studying. On top of that, I found the work very isolating. I was very siloed in my research, with nobody outside of my advisor I could really talk with about what I was doing. My mental health took a big hit.

I ended up finishing with a Masters degree instead, moved back to my hometown and spent a few summers working construction. 

Eventually I went back to school for a Masters in statistics and now I work as a wildlife biometrician. I still get to do a little bit of more theoretical research but my day to day involves working with tangible concepts. I can see the impacts of my work in real time, and I have colleagues I work with every day who aren't in my extremely specific field.

I have huge respect for those who are able to preserve and succeed in pure math, but I am so much happier for having given it up (even though I sometimes still feel a hint of guilt about it.)","i went to grad school in algebraic geometry, with the intention of doing a phd and going into academia. i didn't exactly hit the wall your describing - i continued to do well in classes and produced a bit of decent research - but it stopped being fun for me.

There are lots of techniques that can help you learn and perform more effectively.

I also had a terrible time in math classes in both high school and as an undergraduate, and yet today, after 30 years of teaching, I'm a retired math professor.

The thing that completely changed math for me was learning how to properly read a math textbook so that I could apply my talents for reading and writing to math.

What is the best way for a person to study and master mathematics?,"You have a good intuition that just memorizing solutions won't help you much. You should try and solve problems on your own.

how do i actually get good at math,"math isn‚Äôt just about memorizing rules, it‚Äôs about learning how to think with them and the skill you‚Äôre struggling with isn‚Äôt knowledge it‚Äôs flexibility being able to take what you know and bend it around a weird new problem without freaking out

what helps is doing practice that‚Äôs not just repetitive drills but stuff that actually forces you to figure out why something works and how to build connections

try this kinda rhythm when you‚Äôre learning something new:

read or watch it once
then close your notes and try explaining it to yourself in your own words like you‚Äôre teaching it
then try solving a type of problem without looking at examples first
if you get stuck, don‚Äôt give up yet instead ask yourself: what tools do i have in my math toolbox and what am i being asked to find

this is how you train your brain to think like a puzzle solver, not just a homework finisher

also inference problems? they‚Äôre scary cause they make you feel like you‚Äôre supposed to be clever on demand but what they‚Äôre actually testing is whether you can step back, stay calm, and try something even if it‚Äôs wrong at first

last thing, get comfy with failure on practice stuff like legit say to yourself ‚Äúi‚Äôm gonna try this even if i screw it up‚Äù cause every wrong attempt is a step closer to building that mental map you feel like you don‚Äôt have yet

you got the curiosity, the love for trig, the self-awarenessall you need now is time, reps, and some self-forgiveness when your brain freezes for a bit you‚Äôre not bad at math, you‚Äôre just still learning how to use it, and that‚Äôs a skill you can 100 percent build","math isn‚Äôt just about memorizing rules, it‚Äôs about learning how to think with them and the skill you‚Äôre struggling with isn‚Äôt knowledge it‚Äôs flexibility being able to take what you know and bend it around a weird new problem without freaking out

Relearning Math from the ground up,"If you want a refresher of mathematics, then use Khan Academy and do the Course Challenges up to Calculus.  Anything you don't get 100% on, review it until you do, then take the Course Challenge Again.  Start low, Pre-Algebra.  You can also go from 'have a basic grasp of the material' to 'am adept at using the material' by using the AOPS Alcumus question bank (start after you've done Pre-Algebra in Khan) and work your way up to 'green' or even 'blue' in all skills up through Pre-Calc.  Since you want to do a math degree, don't skip the Number Theory or the Probability and Counting sections, do those too.  Those all require tricky and creative application of the skills you're being taught in Khan and supplemented elsewhere.  Don't give up easily because mathematics is about having a tricky problem and then solving it creatively, and then proving what you've done.

Beyond that, you can also 'read ahead' in Khan to get to Calc 2 and 3, Linear Algebra - do those if you have time so you won't be faced with all brand new material in class.  Also get the book called 'How to Prove It' (or a similar one) to better understand proofs, because advanced mathematics requires you prove things - advanced mathematics isn't being a *user* of mathematics, it's being a *creator* of mathematics and when you create math you have to prove it.

During your now-limited free time you can read about various proofs in mathematical history, understanding how people have come up with math and try when you can to come up with your own. Mathematics at the advanced level - pure math particularly - is an art.

Most people have never been exposed to true mathematics, in the sense of the puzzle-solving creation of mathematics.  Maybe a dash of it in geometry, but even then it was half-hidden.  Good luck!","if you want a refresher of mathematics, then use khan academy and do the course challenges up to calculus.  anything you don't get 100% on, review it until you do, then take the course challenge again.  start low, pre-algebra.  you can also go from 'have a basic grasp of the material' to 'am adept at using the material' by using the aops alcumus question bank (start after you've done pre-algebra in khan) and work your way up to 'green' or even 'blue' in all skills up through pre-calc.  since you want to do a math degree, don't skip the number theory or the probability and counting sections, do those too.  those all require tricky and creative application of the skills you're being taught in khan and supplemented elsewhere.  don't give up easily because mathematics is about having a tricky problem and then solving it creatively, and then proving what you've done.

How much should proofs 'click',"Human intuition is a marvelous thing.  It has allowed humans to live and evolve for millions of years.   Humans have unrivaled capability to visualize a problem and to abstract solutions. 

However, humans are stuck in this evolution.  Most people still visualize numbers by counting on their fingers.    There are some mathematical concepts that push the limits of human intuition.   

For example, you can‚Äôt solve all quadratic equations visually because it requires you to visualize negative area.     Instead, we use formal algebra.  We develop an intuition for form and not function.  Proofs are more about understanding form than what the proof is trying to say.   Proofs will ‚Äúclick‚Äù on that level.","human intuition is a marvelous thing.  it has allowed humans to live and evolve for millions of years.   humans have unrivaled capability to visualize a problem and to abstract solutions.

How do I do well in Math?,"I don't know exactly what topics are covered in which years in the Canadian curriculum. So, did you do okay at the beginning of algebra? It feels like one possible explanation is that you were comfortable as long as the focus was *calculation*, and were fine doing problems where the focus was getting numerical values for purely numerical expressions. The crucial question is, how did you do the first time algebra was introduced?

So if I had to guess, I would say that sometime near the beginning of algebra, you missed an important concept, and without that concept nothing afterward made any sense. Some examples of things you might have missed or misunderstood are: What is an equation? What is a variable? What are these things used for? But I could easily have missed the mark here, and the missing piece is something else.

If that diagnosis is correct, then the right thing to do would be go to Khan Academy (free, registration recommended) and start with their 7th grade class. I'd recommend that starting level because you need to learn how to use Khan's interface on material you know already. The sequence from there would be, 7th grade, 8th grade, Algebra 1, Geometry (optional), Algebra 2, Trigonometry, Precalculus. (I *think* trig and precalculus are probably the equivalent of ""advanced functions"" but I'm not sure.) But I am guessing that somewhere in Algebra 1 or Algebra 2, Khan will tell you something (the missing concepts) that make you go ""Oh! Is *that* what they meant?"" and things will get a lot clearer.","i don't know exactly what topics are covered in which years in the canadian curriculum. so, did you do okay at the beginning of algebra? it feels like one possible explanation is that you were comfortable as long as the focus was *calculation*, and were fine doing problems where the focus was getting numerical values for purely numerical expressions. the crucial question is, how did you do the first time algebra was introduced?

Can we talk about why pi is approximated as 22/7 when 3.14 is the same amount of digits to memorize?,"It's often convenient to work in fractions if you're doing arithmetic in your head.

Book recommendations to learn calculus(only integration part),"'Learning integration properly' is a bit ambiguous, since you usually learn it once for applications, then if you study mathematics you repeatedly relearn it at various levels of abstraction.

Larson, Stewart, and Rogawski all have excellent introductory textbooks. Spivak, Lang, and Folland have texts that are more rigorous and perhaps more 'proper', but they largely assume you've seen some calculus before.

Before studying integration though, I *highly* recommend you review your algebra. Mastering algebra is a much more efficient use of time than starting integration, and it can be difficult for young people to recognize their level of mastery.

But if you feel all the problems in your algebra resources are easy to solve, give the Larson book a try.","'learning integration properly' is a bit ambiguous, since you usually learn it once for applications, then if you study mathematics you repeatedly relearn it at various levels of abstraction.

A lot of practice will minimize the number of mistakes you make, yes, but you can help yourself in another way, too.

"Will real analysis help me truly understand calculus, or is it just formal proofs?","As a physicist, I would generally say that analysis is not super useful for physics. (However, it is super interesting in its own right and definitely important if you want to study mathematics seriously.) The main use of calculus in physics is doing calculations, and analysis is not super useful for learning how to calculate. But let me unpack that a little bit.

Part of what analysis is trying to do is set things like the real numbers and continuity on a rigorous mathematical footing. Mathematicians need to worry very much about edge cases, and the exact conditions needed for a theorem to hold.

In physics, we very rarely need that level of precision. No number in physics is defined to an infinite number of decimal places. Functions that are relevant for physics tend to be smooth and automatically satisfy the conditions of theorems in analysis. Or, there is a physical reason for functions not to satisfy those conditions and be singular, and the singularities need to be dealt with using logic that is at least partly based in physics, where pure math on its own would not give you a unique way to proceed.

Now, what I'm not saying is that being able to calculate in physics is purely a mechanical process that involves no understanding. To the contrary, there are some quite subtle things that you do need to understand as you go deeper into physics. But in my experience, you tend to learn these concepts by doing problems and examples relevant for physics, and proofs don't really give you that experience.

Also, if you end up studying, say, differential geometry for general relativity, then it might help to know some analysis and geometry, because the level of mathematical sophistication is higher and it's useful to know some concepts from analysis like neighborhoods and metric functions. But, I didn't take an analysis class in undergrad (I self studied some of it later out of curiosity) and I ended up getting through general relativity fine. In general, physicists teach the math that is needed to understand the physics in physics classes.

To try and summarize it... calculus is a set of rules. Analysis is about building those rules -- logically establishing why the rules are true and the exact situations where they hold. Physicists are more like clients of those tools -- we don't necessarily care exactly how they are built, but what's important is knowing how to use them in situations that are important for us.","as a physicist, i would generally say that analysis is not super useful for physics.

Is polar integration and integrating surfaces of revolution ever useful?,"They come up at times. It is hard to say how often or if they come up more or less than they did fifty years ago. Even if those specific problems don't come up, they train you for other problems. How well it is hard to say.

You might have seen some solids of revolution about like ball bearings, cylinders, wheels, and so forth. Even when the symmetry is broken the object might be mostly symmetric. 

Maybe you are going to specializes in super unsymmetric mechanics and it will be of no use to you. You might have noticed you are not the only student in your class.

How do I understand 3D vectors better,"I've taught quite a few undergraduate and graduate engineering students that needed a very strong understanding of vectors. One of the easiest recommendations I had for all of them was to read at least the first chapter of ""A brief on tensor analysis"" by Simmonds. It's published by Springer, so if you're at a university then there's a decent chance you already have free access to it. It looks like it's also available on the internet archive. Also, it is very brief. The whole book is roughly 100 pages. The part I'm recommending is only about 15 pages.

A lot of people teach vectors in a purely algebraic way. They introduce equations as definitions handed down from on high, and then just tell you to shut up and calculate with them. This is an atrocious way to teach. 

For others, all of the teaching involves making computations using the components of a vector, and this leaves students feeling completely justified in thinking that vectors are really just lists of numbers. This is also an atrocious way to teach. 

So what does Simmonds do that's different? He certainly provides you with all the standard definitions and formulas you might be looking for, but he goes further to highlight the **geometric** significance of these equations. He shows you why these equations make sense (routinely without making calculations involving components). One of the main reasons physicists / engineers use vectors (and tensors) all over the place is **because** of their geometric properties. Using them is one way of ensuring that different people can use different descriptions of an event (e.g., by using different coordinate systems or reference frames) and yet they still agree on what happened.

In case you're also in need of a resource for learning how to use different coordinate systems (e.g., describing vectors in polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates) then this book is also a great resource for that information as well. If you know some basic calculus you can derive all those from scratch in a few minutes.

Is Khan Academy sufficient to learn elementary algebra and calculus?,"It's good enough for an overview.

Again, this is a very valuable exercise.

If you got slightly below average grades, then you may be correct that the issue is mostly just your conscientiousness (aka how careful you are in reading questions, carefully doing each step of the problem, and then reviewing your work after you come to the answer).  That is trainable.

Bottom-top approach in math textbooks,"1. Bottom-up is just the more efficient way to learn something (it's also easier to teach). You learn the rules first, then you apply them. Long-term, it's always easier to go from general to specific. Having brief overview can help you remember the ideas, but intuition doesn't help you *do* things mechanically. Physics and stats texts always frustrate me because there is so much fluffy exposition before letting you get your hands dirty. And when I tutor physics students bottom-up, they are suddenly able to do the problems they couldn't when their physics prof just told them about cool intuition tricks. Most of them still can't do basic algebra. In my experience, people who clamor for a top-down approach don't realize they've already learned a lot of the bottom intuition, or they are people who are not serious about learning the substance. Intuition comes from experience, not authority. (Also, do you want your physics classes catered to mathematicians? Why should it go the other way?)
2. I've never had a math book or teacher that didn't give the motivation first. Maybe it's just briefer than you want, but it's largely fluff and students can think about it later if they want. You are just wrong about your conclusion how mathematicians think. Also students get angry with you if you ""waste"" their time with stuff that won't be on the test, and math majors want to get to the meat anyway. 
3. Applied math courses take an approach more like what you're saying, but a theory class will be about theory. 
4. You probably underestimate how much physics intuition just by being alive. You can learn a lot just by tossing a ball at a wall. In math, you have the extra burden of being the computer/universe/simulator, so you have to master the rules before you can do experiments.","1. bottom-up is just the more efficient way to learn something (it's also easier to teach). you learn the rules first, then you apply them. long-term, it's always easier to go from general to specific. having brief overview can help you remember the ideas, but intuition doesn't help you *do* things mechanically. physics and stats texts always frustrate me because there is so much fluffy exposition before letting you get your hands dirty. and when i tutor physics students bottom-up, they are suddenly able to do the problems they couldn't when their physics prof just told them about cool intuition tricks. most of them still can't do basic algebra. in my experience, people who clamor for a top-down approach don't realize they've already learned a lot of the bottom intuition, or they are people who are not serious about learning the substance. intuition comes from experience, not authority.

Why would I do calculations with radicals in a real world scenario?,"A number like the square root of seven is a real number, it's between two and three on the number line, and it represents a specific quantity and just like any other real number does. If you multiply the square root of seven by two, you have a quantity that is twice as big; if you divide the square root of seven by the cube root of three, you get a smaller quantity which has the same ratio to the square root of seven as the number one has to the cube root of three.

Yes exponents get used in geometry, but ""square roots"" don't require referencing a specific square shape. Exponents represent repeated multiplication, and the radical is one of the inverse operations for exponents (the other inverse operation is the logarithm).

Here's an idea that often gets skipped over, if your investment account went down 10% one day and up 6% the next day, what was the average change per day? You wouldn't want to just add those numbers and divide by two, because in this scenario we aren't adding up the percentages. Instead, what we're doing is multiplying by 0.90 and then multiplying by 1.06, so the average should be some number that could be multiplied by itself (squared) and give the same result as multiplying 0.9 by 1.06. That product is 0.954, and the number we want is the square root of 0.954 (which is 0.977, meaning on average the investment account went down by 2.33% per day). I may be explaining this badly, but it's called the ""geometric mean,"" you multiply together your n number of multipliers and then take the n-th root of the product.","a number like the square root of seven is a real number, it's between two and three on the number line, and it represents a specific quantity and just like any other real number does. if you multiply the square root of seven by two, you have a quantity that is twice as big; if you divide the square root of seven by the cube root of three, you get a smaller quantity which has the same ratio to the square root of seven as the number one has to the cube root of three.

Understanding the point of the unit circle,"It's really great you noticed that the other portions of the circle are reflections of the quarter arc between 0 and œÄ/2.

I cant stop working things out in my head. how do i stop?,"> how i work it out: lets say for example a 38% increase in 735$ what i'd do is get 10% which is 73.5$ then times it by 3 to get 30% which is 220.5$% then i'd half it to get 5% which is 36.75$ then i'd get 1% which is 7.35$ then times it by 3 which is 279$.

Sure, this is valid, if a bit convoluted. You're saying that:

(.38)735 = 3(0.10)735 + (1/2)(0.10)735 + 3(0.01)735

I would probably give marks for writing that out. What the method that you're supposed to be using? You're basically doing column multiplication indirectly.

> I know how to get 1% but i also don't, i just KNOW whats 1% or 10% i have no way of doing it in my head. 

Well, sure, these are easy because you can find them by just moving the decimal point over.

How do I pass Engineering mathematics?,"I don't know if it will help you, but try not thinking about math, think instead what it represents. At the uni I studied experimental physics and our professors where never satisfied with formula/equatio/etc, they always asked about physics behind. Treat math as a strange language, that describes everything around you. Like any other language it has rules, grammar, shortcuts etc, but in this case you can kinda reverse engineer some of it by actually observing.
Here an example from my uni days: we werre studying opamps and professor (RIP Prof. Shevchenko, after your classes I fell in love with electronics!) showed us how you can calculate feedback loops built with resistors. Aftewards he gave us a tip: you can treat any component or network of components in the loops as a resistor with some weird properties and replace your current/voltage operations with operators, that are appropriate for your components, i.e. to get voltage drop on capacitor instead of U=IR use U=1/c√ó‚à´Idt. After this lecture I never had any issues calculating even craziest feedback loops because I am just thinking about voltage drops and current flows in strange resistors, not about huge integro-differential equation.

At the end, you only need to understand nature of and know mathematical concept behind components and processes of the system you are describing - this way you can always look ath the result and ask yourself: will it work this way?

"I‚Äôm a teenager, but was never given a proper education. How do I teach myself?","Well first, I must sincerely applaud you for writing this. It‚Äôs a moment of vulnerability and I appreciate you for sharing this, it can't have been easy. And I‚Äôd like to highlight that the way you‚Äôve articulated yourself and are introspective of your habits (or perhaps lack thereof) puts you in the upper echelon of most adults, much less high school students. Most people don‚Äôt really remember the things they learn nor do they actually care to and this is coming from a college student.

My honest piece of advice: find something you love (preferably STEM-adjacent but it doesn‚Äôt have to be) and dedicate yourself to that. A lot of the ‚Äúreal‚Äù learning in my experience comes from trying or building and subsequently failing at new things. Heck, more than half the things I know are from projects I‚Äôve done outside of school. Schools these days (even universities) rely on rote-memorization for most topics which doesn‚Äôt really work because at that point they're just making you study for an exam rather for a concept, hence the reason most people don't remember much from college. But I digress. . .

Since this is a math subreddit and as a mathematics major a few websites I absolutely adore are:

**Paul's Online Math Notes (https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/)**

* I find his stuff immensely helpful for most things in Algebra and above. If you understand basic arithmetic (operations, variables, basic functions and their properties (e.g. linear, slope, etc.)).
* When you get to Calculus, Differential Equations, and Linear Algebra (which imo you should do all at some point in your life) this website will be a godsend.

**Khan Academy (https://www.khanacademy.org/)**

* The obligatory suggestion. I like his stuff for the most part but not all of it (but for you it's more than fine). The best part is everything is free and most of the content is extremely intuitive.
* I'd say start here, do a few practice quizzes/tests to gauge where your learning is at. From there you can hone in on WHERE to start. Blindly choosing trigonometry when you haven't learned basic algebra is only going to set you back. There is ABSOLUTELY NO SHAME in starting from basics. Most people who fail out of their classes are people who have foundations that absolutely suck.

**Mathispower4u (https://mathispower4u.com/)**

* Is a youtube channel and website run by James Sousa who is a professor at Phoenix College. Super incredible channel with dozens upon dozens of courses with fantastic videos and explanations. I would use his stuff as a supplement to a real professor. I have done this many times quite successfully.

**OpenStax (https://openstax.org/)**

* Is an open resource textbook publisher. They've got some great stuff. I've never used their algebra textbooks but have immensely enjoyed their Calculus series. It's not very rigorous (fairly easy-to-understand) and loaded with good examples and exercises.



These four-sources should pretty easily get you through high school math and even Calculus. Most people including myself would recommend you get a teacher/attend a class, but sitting in a class and taking notes is not for everyone, not to mention good professors are few and far between. But please make a plan for yourself and commit to it. I don't know how you study‚Äìonly you do. Learning to study (itself) is an art.

Find out what works best for you. And then tailor your plan according to that. Many successful people have homeschooled themselves throughout life. And being able to teach yourself is a gift on levels you can't possibly comprehend right now. I've put some suggestions for other topics but you are probably best served by asking people more knowledgeable than I am in their respective fields:

For English, unless you really really love it, I'd just read a ton. Fiction, non-fiction, Wikipedia (can be unreliable sometimes), comics, etc. I still read quite a bit (although not as much as I should) but it's mostly non-fiction. I've observed that people with the best vernacular and diction are extremely well-read.

Science is tougher because it covers a much broader range than math does. Physics, Chemistry, Biology, etc. They are all big with tons of concentration. Khan Academy is pretty good for this kind of stuff. I was never a great science student though I was (and still am) endlessly fascinated with it.

History, like science, is largely dependent on what you want to study. I think as a good rule of thumb, you should study (presuming you are American) U.S. History. Agrarian and Colonial America, the Declaration, the Constitution, Westward Expansion, Industrialization, Reconstruction, all the big wars (Revolution, Civil, Spanish-American, WWI, WWII, Korean, Vietnam, Cold War). It's increasingly concerning how little most people know about it really. You should also read about the rest of the world lol. Colonialism, Expansion, Silk-Road, Empires, Golden Ages, Renaissance, Enlightenment, Protestant Reformation, etc. You don't NEED to know it, I'm just a huge history buff‚Äì and who knows? Maybe one day it'll come in clutch during a trivia competition (definitely NOT speaking from experience ;). r/history are absolute sweethearts for the most part and would be more than happy to help you.

Sorry for the long-winded post, I wrote this on the fly, and I'm sure there are multiple grammatical and (I hope not) conceptual errors. Please feel free to DM me if you'd like. Learning is an incredibly rewarding experience should you let it!


P.S. oh and I forgot. Find a project you'd like to tackle. Start with something challenging yet approachable. It should be something that fascinates you. Learn the tools/skills required and build away! Don't expect to succeed overnight. You can find tons of ideas on the internet.

Linear Algebra...,"Yeh.. That sounds about right. We do end up remembering all of the details because linear algebra shows up everywhere, you keep using it so it stays in your head.

Also, this is just the first example you see of a set that is closed under certain operations, there are a whole bunch of them and they are all very useful. Think of a vector space as a restriction on what you can usually do in an equation.

Like, numbers (fields) are amazing in the sense that you are able to manipulate them with great flexibility to solve very complex equations. So if whatever your working with behaves like a number (field) then you're golden. However, sometimes what you are working with does not act like a number at all.

How to cover all the necessary materials and content for both AMC 12 and AIME,"Stop over-planning. I made this mistake too when I first started competition math. This year, I almost made USAJMO with an 8 on AIME, since I did USAMTS. I got a 5 last year.

Literally, just do problems. Do AIME problems and HMMT problems and whatever problems until you feel your head hurt. The theory for AIME isn‚Äôt particular difficult. I would say the content in intermediate algebra and precalculus is enough for algebra (I didn‚Äôt really do these books, but the material itself is good). For geometry, just understand all of the computational formulas and do a ton of computational geometry problems from various contests. Number theory doesn‚Äôt show up very much on AIME anymore, but knowing stuff like the basics, CRT, special functions, and modular arithmetic is enough for the two problems where it‚Äôll appear. The only theory you really need for combo is recursion and some stuff about probability and expected value; the rest is just problem solving, the basics, and practice. I would avoid paying for any resources that aren‚Äôt Alphastar, AoPS, AMSP, or Evan Chen stuff. There‚Äôs no silver bullet for improving. Just do problems.

For practice taking tests, go to as many college competitions as possible. I went to tournaments at Berkeley, Princeton, Caltech, MIT, and CMU this year.

Also, unless you got above a 200 index this year, you realistically won‚Äôt make USAMO next year unless you get really lucky or you‚Äôre just super talented. I tried making USAJMO in 2 years and I narrowly missed it this year, and making USAMO is much more difficult.

What do you do when you can't understand a math topic (or even explanations on that topic)  AT ALL?,"When stuck, I had three preliminary approaches in high school, college, and graduate school:

A) Read: I go over my notes, my textbook (this was enough for most of high school), other textbooks online and in a library if I have access to a graduate-level math department's resources, Wikipedia, and so on. I would look for any relevant content and examples, and if I could find a solutions manual, even better because they often would include explanations that were never covered for harder problems in class. Working on easier problems did not help me at all for novel variants that were totally unfamiliar.

B) Ask: I would go to instructors and TA's and ask questions. Some were more helpful than others. I would also consult peers to see if they had figured something out that was vexing me.

C) SSR: Scribble, stare, and pray. I would rewrite and redo the problems a few times until I reached the point where I got stuck. It really sucked when I didn't even know where to begin. I wasted soooo much paper trying to rewrite proofs and spent hours thinking about problems with no hint in sight. I would pray to God for an answer.

This started happening with upper-level proof classes, and it reminded me of Henri Poincar√©'s article on Mathematical Creation, but decades later after starting formal meditation practices in my 30's, I am more convinced than ever before that it was a blessing obtained through all of the praying and receiving answers subconsciously from the Divine.

I understand math but can't execute,"Hi! Math teacher here. Your problem is pretty common, often times students grasp concepts and explanations but misuse or misinterpret them during exams.

The most common cause is a student ignoring (or only skimming) their textbooks. (Good) textbooks are designed to introduce a definition, build upon it, and then challenge it. 

As a student, you must understand that applying concepts in mathematics, logically, leads to new conclusions and understandings of the topic. As a teacher, there is only so much I can teach during classes. Mostly introductory or fundamental concepts for your understanding, but not that much beyond that.

Here is an example:

When teaching an introductory course to mathematical logic, one will teach basic set theory, and with it, De Morgan's Law:

(AUB)^c = A^c ‚à© B^c

However, it is common to leave it to students to prove that such law is true for any finite number of sets (via induction) and then for an infinite family of sets.

Both of these statements could be good exam questions that students should have tried to do by simply following a good textbook.","hi! math teacher here. your problem is pretty common, often times students grasp concepts and explanations but misuse or misinterpret them during exams.

As for calculus, it depends on how much high school math you remember and frankly how smart you are. Calculus just clicks for some people, while others struggle.

On average, a typical university class should take 130-160 hours of teaching+studying time.

Let's say you're studying 4 hours per day and have good studying skills, it should then take you 33 - 40 days to learn a university class worth of material. A reasonable estimate would be on the higher end - everyone has off days and sometimes you get stuck.

Calculus has 3 parts. Calc 1 covers derivatives, limits and basic integration. Calc 2 does real integration and introduces a lot of theorems and applications of calculus. Calc 3 covers all calc 1&2 material and extends it to multiple variables or dimensions.

Each one should take you around 40 days, if you're committed. But also, if you only need to learn calc 1 for example you're much better off.","i don't know what math 3 is, so i can't help you there.

"College Algebra: using 2œÄ, œÄ, or œÄ/2 for angles.","Two pi is a complete rotation.

A lot of students have ""degree brain"" in that they only think of angle measures in terms of degrees. Just like inches and centimeters are different systems. If you insist on one system mentally you're not going to be able to handle other systems.

Early on you may think of 360¬∞ as a circle. Then you go to math class and 2pi is a circle. Then in astronomy 1,296,000 arcseconds are a circle. Join the Army as an artillery soldier and 6400 mils is a circle. Then become an engineer and 400 gradiens is a circle. Then you start to understand that the world isn't just measuring angles in degrees.

The ""plus 2pi\*N"" part is saying that whatever angle *X* between 0¬∞ and 360¬∞ that satisfies the equation, so does *X* \+ 360¬∞ or *X* \+ 720¬∞ and so on. It's expressing all the different angles which are the same in a way such that n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

For example sine of 30¬∞ is 0.5 so *sin(30¬∞) = 0.5*. But sine of 390¬∞ also equals 0.5. And so does sine of -330¬∞. So what's a compact way to say that all those are equal? The answer is *sin(30¬∞+n\*360¬∞)=0.5* where n=...-2, -1, 0, 1, 2... .

Logs on Logs on Logs,"Having watched the video after giving a solution in a comment here, I thought I might leave some constructive feedback.

* You immediately use the log base change formula but don't explain where it comes from or how it could be derived. It's obviously crucial to solving this question, is an incredibly helpful tool for other problems, and its existence is a really fascinating part of logarithms that any student should be encouraged to think about rather than just pull from memory. But you don't really comment on that; you just pull it out as a tool. Wouldn't take long to derive, either. I imagine a student who didn't immediately think of it when they first saw the question posed would be left none this wiser by how you use it in the video, but maybe they're not your intended audience.
* There's also no comment on **why** that formula should be something the student thinks about in this question. Lots of students struggle with just feeling like they don't know how to start a problem. It would probably help to talk about why converting a product of logs with different bases to a product of fractions is a good idea in this instance. Something like 'notice that the arguments of each log forms a sequence, and the bases of these logs form a very similar sequence; wouldn't it be great if we could find a way to cancel them out?' would do the job to open the hood under the problem solving process.
* Once you have the expression as a product of fractions, the way forward is clearly related to things like Telescoping Series. Signposting that this is actually a commonly used method for evaluating series and products in other problems would be great.
* For my taste, saying ""this cancels out with terms in the ellipsis"" is very hand-wavey and could easily be formalised without losing the audience. Talk about a general term of the sequence: log(2n+5)/log(2n+1) and draw their attention to the fact that the numerator of the k^(th) term cancels with the denominator of the (k+2)^(th) and the denominator of the k^(th) cancels with the numerator of the (k-2)^(th) or similar, and therefore all we're left with is the first two denominators and the last two numerators.
* When you get \[log(25)log(27)\]/\[log(3)log(5)\] you cite another rule about logs (i.e. log(a^(b)) = b log(a)) without explanation or derivation. Seems like an oversight. Also seems like an oversight not to relate this to or ground it with reference to the log base change formula you used earlier.
* I also think there are more interesting questions about the problem, like ""can we construct other such sequences or is this one unique?"", and how one might look for similar patterns, and what (if anything) they might show us. The fact that this product comes out as a natural number ought to be a surprise to most students, so getting them to think about why could be an easy win.
* Lastly, 'logs on logs on logs' (for me at least) evokes things like ""log(log(log(x)))"" rather than the product of logs. This is my most petty note, but the fact that the title evokes something unrelated to the problem is annoying and might be easily avoided. Though regional uses of the expression may vary and perhaps your intended audience will immediately 'get it'.

Granted, I'm not sure what audience you're trying to reach or what messages you're trying to imbue. But it feels like there are some more important lessons (like where we get the base change formula from, or how to approach a novel problem) you've missed and some much more interesting questions (like whether or not the fact you can make a sequence of logs give a product of a natural number tells us much, or if there are other sequences out there like this) that you easily could have stretched for and just haven't. By not looking at those, what's left feels like little more than a 'here's an example of me doing a test question without showing any of the thoughts behind it' video. That would be good for a student working through past papers, but your back catalog doesn't really suggest that you're covering whole sections from past papers or textbooks.","having watched the video after giving a solution in a comment here, i thought i might leave some constructive feedback.

* for my taste, saying ""this cancels out with terms in the ellipsis"" is very hand-wavey and could easily be formalised without losing the audience. talk about a general term of the sequence: log(2n+5)/log(2n+1) and draw their attention to the fact that the numerator of the k^(th) term cancels with the denominator of the (k+2)^(th) and the denominator of the k^(th) cancels with the numerator of the (k-2)^(th) or similar, and therefore all we're left with is the first two denominators and the last two numerators.
* when you get \[log(25)log(27)\]/\[log(3)log(5)\] you cite another rule about logs (i.e. log(a^(b)) = b log(a)) without explanation or derivation. seems like an oversight. also seems like an oversight not to relate this to or ground it with reference to the log base change formula you used earlier.
* i also think there are more interesting questions about the problem, like ""can we construct other such sequences or is this one unique?"", and how one might look for similar patterns, and what (if anything) they might show us. the fact that this product comes out as a natural number ought to be a surprise to most students, so getting them to think about why could be an easy win.
* lastly, 'logs on logs on logs' (for me at least) evokes things like ""log(log(log(x)))"" rather than the product of logs. this is my most petty note, but the fact that the title evokes something unrelated to the problem is annoying and might be easily avoided. though regional uses of the expression may vary and perhaps your intended audience will immediately 'get it'.

granted, i'm not sure what audience you're trying to reach or what messages you're trying to imbue. but it feels like there are some more important lessons (like where we get the base change formula from, or how to approach a novel problem) you've missed and some much more interesting questions (like whether or not the fact you can make a sequence of logs give a product of a natural number tells us much, or if there are other sequences out there like this) that you easily could have stretched for and just haven't. by not looking at those, what's left feels like little more than a 'here's an example of me doing a test question without showing any of the thoughts behind it' video. that would be good for a student working through past papers, but your back catalog doesn't really suggest that you're covering whole sections from past papers or textbooks.",0.28243083,0

Just failed my first math exam. Any tips?,"I was a math major. Linear Algebra was hard, and I‚Äôm good at math. So I understand.

Going forward, just 2 pieces of advice:

1. Spend the time studying much earlier, starting from when you begin a new unit/chapter/semester/whatever. I think you already know that.

2. Read the textbook, and take the time to understand everything. Don‚Äôt just do the homework problems. That‚Äôs not enough. Read the explanations, proofs, work through them yourself, ask your prof if there‚Äôs something in the text that‚Äôs not clear.

3. Turn off your goddamn phone and study.

Is it possible to learn pre-algebra to algebra 2 in 5-6 months,"I think what you‚Äôre doing is very cool, I had a similar experience going into calculus(I had no clue what sine and cosine were and struggled to manipulate equations). You could do 4 hours a day, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend going into this with that mindset. If you fall behind with that kind of goal, it will be a whole lot harder to catch up. Instead, I recommend a consistent goal you can totally crush (which will motivate you to keep going, remember that 5-6 months of focused consistent learning is better than 2 weeks of rushing and then never picking the subject up again). You are already in a program, you are busy already. 

Also, many people go into calculus with some gaps in their algebra knowledge and also their trigonometry knowledge. Many people pick this up as they take the class. you don‚Äôt need to know all of algebra. Generally, you just need a few tricks to do well in calculus.However people can pick things up on their own only because they have built the skill of learning how to learn math. 

So generally, don‚Äôt view this as learning how algebra, but instead learning how to learn math consistently. I know you wish to transfer soon, so here‚Äôs what I recommend: Instead of doing 4 hours a day, start by just doing 15 minutes a day every day. If you can manage that for a week, up it by 10 minutes in the next week. Continue increasing the time in small intervals (it can be more than 10 minutes if you think you can handle it) until you find a sweet spot in terms of studying time (2 good focused hours are MUCH better than 4 hours where you don‚Äôt really focus). It‚Äôs okay if you miss a few days here and there, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs okay to move on if you‚Äôve hit 5 days that week. This is a general guideline that may be helpful, but you know yourself best, so you may have to tweak it to meet your learning needs. Just please take it slow. 

One final tip: With everything you learn see if you can understand how it helps you solve real-world problems/ be a better thinker. This means you‚Äôll engage with the material, and it will feel super cool to learn something new! You got this, feel free to message me with updates/questions along your journey.

Is tenacity REALLY that much more important than aptitude?,"I'd say it is a bit mixed. If you don't have sufficient natural aptitude all the tenacity in the world just won't matter. The reverse is less true, if you have extreme aptitude just a little tenacity is sufficient to get through the classes. The grit is more important in forging into original work, where it is important to not give up when little initial progress is made. You really can't develop the habit of fortitude until you are challenged, this is one of the goals of university.

When I was in undergrad there was a fellow student who we called genius boy. He had been doing graduate level math at a very young age, until his parents put him back in Jr High for social reasons. We were physics majors, so math ability is very helpful. The physics was new for him and the math was slightly rusty as it had been many years since he did that. A homework set that we would spend 12hr on to get 1/2 done he would do the entire thing in an hour or two. He would take the homework to a bar and have a beer as he's working on it to see if he could get it done before getting too buzzed to do it. He called it racing the beer, it added to the challenge for him. 

On a few assignments we (my study group) tried studying with him. It turned out to be pointless, he was just on a very different level than we were. Even when he tried to explain things to us, it just didn't matter, we couldn't understand. I'm not weak at math, my Sr year in HS I placed 9th in the state math contest. But in the ocean there is always a bigger fish. Fast forward many years, we both had successful science careers. He had insights into Maxwell's equations that pushed electrodynamics forward. Mine, more pedestrian, but still interesting. For me my math ability was never the limiting factor, it was my English and writing ability.

Calc 2 can be brutal. I had a pretty easy time with it, but I think that relates to the class. My class had the goal of teaching calculus. My daughter who is also very strong in math was flunking calc 2 before she dropped it. She took a different version and got an A. She got A's in all her college math classes and graduated with honors. The Calc 2 she took was designed to weed people out and thin the herd. I looked at her problems and I thought they were completely unreasonable, I would have failed the class as well.

I'd say it is reasonable to see how your aptitude compares to your peers.

How to read Mathematics?,"I don't understand how you can understand formula but don't know how to 'read' it?

So, using function notation as an example, namely f(x), to read it would be to say ""f of x."" To understand it would be to know that it's an equation that produces a unique y value for each x. Another way to think about functions is in terms of cause and effect: the x values are independent variables (the cause), the y values (the effect) are dependent on x, and each individual cause produces one effect. To explain it with analogy: each product at the grocery store has a unique bar code (the x value), and scanning it produces a single price (the y value); if a product is scanned and two different prices pop up, it's not a function. Thinking of it spatially you could do a vertical line test on a graph: if a vertical line crosses 2 points on the graph, it's not a function (which could only happen if the same x value yields 2 different y values).

There are many, many ways to understand something in math. You could understand it in technical terms, by analogy, or by visualizing what's going on, and you can explain something to someone using one or all of these methods. Some students are visual thinkers, others prefer verbal explanations while others like analogy, and a good teacher would incorporate all these methods into a lesson.

How do you lot mentally double and halve numbers?,"A good approach to mental math sometimes is to compute what happens to the difference instead of number itself. For example, if you think about 4682 as 328 less than 5000, then doubling it will put you at 652 less than 10K, and halving it will put you at 164 less than 2500.

Likewise, if you want to halve 6794, think about it as `1/2*(6800 - 6) = 6800/2 - 6/2 = 3400 - 3`.

There's a similar trick you can use for squaring numbers near 50:

    53^2 = (50 + 3)*(50 + 3)
    = 50^2 + 2*3*50 + 9
    = 2500 + 3*100 + 3^2

This is super easy to do in your head, just get the rough answer by noticing that this is 3 more than 50, so the square is about 50\^2 + 3\*100 or 2500 + 300 = 2800. If you want the exact answer, then add 3\^2 for 2809.

Works in the other direction too, but subtract the hundreds and still add the square, so 46\^2 = 2500 - 400 + 4\^16 or 2116.","a good approach to mental math sometimes is to compute what happens to the difference instead of number itself. for example, if you think about 4682 as 328 less than 5000, then doubling it will put you at 652 less than 10k, and halving it will put you at 164 less than 2500.

this is super easy to do in your head, just get the rough answer by noticing that this is 3 more than 50, so the square is about 50\^2 + 3\*100 or 2500 + 300 = 2800. if you want the exact answer, then add 3\^2 for 2809.

works in the other direction too, but subtract the hundreds and still add the square, so 46\^2 = 2500 - 400 + 4\^16 or 2116.",0.27612758,0

Is the AOPS series appropriate for an adult learner,"AOPS books are the best high school math textbooks on the market for strong learners who are comfortable being pushed in math.  They're written for people with a knack for math, but are also written in a good mix of a more casual, less impenetrable style while also being quite rigorous.  Their problems are the best in the business as well, from 'normal hard' to 'super hard' that will stretch you and result in a better understanding of the concepts you're learning.  They have an adaptive free question bank in their Alcumus platform as well for extra practice with light gamification.

I can't speak highly enough of their product offerings.  They make great stuff and I wish they were the default textbook in gifted math programs in classrooms.  I use their 'Beast Academy' elementary books for enrichment with my kid and that is also very good (pretty tough too, but it helps with their problem solving as it teaches concepts much more deeply than a typical course).","aops books are the best high school math textbooks on the market for strong learners who are comfortable being pushed in math.  they're written for people with a knack for math, but are also written in a good mix of a more casual, less impenetrable style while also being quite rigorous.  their problems are the best in the business as well, from 'normal hard' to 'super hard' that will stretch you and result in a better understanding of the concepts you're learning.  they have an adaptive free question bank in their alcumus platform as well for extra practice with light gamification.

How was your experience studying Real Analysis?,"I'm Irish. I did Higher-Level Mathemamatics in secondary school. I did Honours Mathematics in university.

At the time, the usual material from Calculus I and II was contained in the Higher-Level school syllabus. We also covered vectors, matrices, and linear transformations, but only in the (2√ó2) case (not enough for a proper treatment of vector calculus).

In my 1st year at university, Honours Mathematics was split into an Analysis part and an Algebra part. Both parts ran over two semesters and were focused on proofs over computations. Students who couldn't keep up were advised to switch to the lower level Mathematical Studies programme.

The Analysis part covered all of the standard material in single variable analysis. The algebra required for multivariable analysis was developed in the Algebra part.

I studied multivariable calculus from an old copy of Thomas & Finney between 1st and 2nd year. In 2nd year, we had Multivariable Analysis and Complex Analysis. I was also the TA for both of these modules for several years while I was a graduate student.","i'm irish. i did higher-level mathemamatics in secondary school. i did honours mathematics in university.

How do I avoid making silly mistakes?,"Something that reduces my rate of making mistakes in math is: i do the calculation 2 ways and cross check. One calculation is the acutal let's say 3+18 = 21, second calc is closer to common core ü§Æ18 needs 2 so 3-2 = 1 so 21

it's awkward and takes a sec (i don't write anything extra) but with enough practice, your arithmetic can be almost perfect cuz you gotta be wrong twice in a row for the mistake to make it on paper

Not as useful for calc.

For just fundamental focus: 

* be hydrated, aim for clear pee
* don't eat greasey stuff before exam
* get lots of sleep, if you have trouble sleeping, exercise
* avoid drugs (unpopular opinion: psychiatric medication is still mind drugs but don't change your dosage without consulting your doc)","something that reduces my rate of making mistakes in math is: i do the calculation 2 ways and cross check. one calculation is the acutal let's say 3+18 = 21, second calc is closer to common core ü§Æ18 needs 2 so 3-2 = 1 so 21
